# PREFACE
* This book is designed to help the student of college chemistry by summarizing the chemical principles of each topic and relating the solution of quantitative problems to those fundamenals. Although the book is not intended to replace a textbook, its solved problems, with complete and detailed solutions, do cover most of the subject matter of a first course in college chemistry. The student is referred to one of the many standard General Chemistry textbooks for such matters as full treatment of nomenclature, descriptive chemistry of the elements, and more extensive exposition and illustration of principles. Both the solved and the supplementary problems are arranged to allow a progression in difficulty within each topic.
* Several important features have been introduced into the sixth edition, notably the kinetic theory of gases, a more formal treatment of thermochemistry, a modern treatment of atomic properties and chemical bonding, and a chapter on chemical kinetics.
* In the seventh edition the early chapters were revised to conform more closely to the methods used in current textbooks to introduce calculational skills to the beginning student. Some changes in notation were made, and the usage of SI units was expanded. An attempt was made to increase the variety of stoichiometry problems, especially in the chapters on gases and solutions, while eliminating some of the very complex problems that arise in gaseous and aqueous equilibria. In the treatment of chemical bonding the subject on Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry was added, conforming to the trend in current texts.
* In the eighth edition we carefully conformed to the language and style of the currently most-used textbooks, for example, using the term "molar mass" broadly, and eliminating "molecular weight" and the like. At least 15% of the problems in each chapter are new, and some old ones were dropped, so that the problems better reflect the practical situations of the laboratory, industry, and the environment. The use of SI units has been expanded further, but liter and atmostphere are retained where appropriate.
* We decided to make this ninth edition meet the needs of today's student by adopting a simplified approach in the content reviews, and liminating the technical jargon. The solved problems were revamped to include replacement problems oriented toward real-world situations. We also added one hundred additional practice problems in areas such as forensics and materials science to reinforce students' learning.

# Chapter 1: Quantities and Units

### Introduction
* One of the responsibilities of those who work in science is to communicate findings. Communication means that we must generate written or spoken materials that will be understood and, often, must do so by reporting measurements. Measurements must performed and reported in a standardized procedure or the communications will be misunderstood.
* Chemistry and physics measure kinds of quantities such as length, velocity, volume, mass, and energy. All measurements are expressed using a number and a unit. The number is used to tell us how many of the units are contained in the quantity being measured. The unit tells us the specific nature of the dimension--measuring in feet is different than measuring in liters. If you are not comfortable with exponents and scientific notation and the rules for dealing with sigificant figures, please refer to Appendix A and B for help.

### Systems of Measurement
* Dimensional calculations are simplified if the unit of each kind of measure is expressed in terms of special reference units. The reference dimensions for mechanics are length, mass, and time. Other measurements performed are expressed in terms of these reference dimensions; units associated with speed contain reference to length and time--mi/hr or m/s. Some units are simple multiples of the reference unit--area is expressed in terms of length squared (m^2) and volume is length cubed (in^3). Other reference dimensions, such as those used to express electrical and termal phenomena, will be introduced later.
* There are differing systems of measurement in use throughout the world, making the ability to convert values between system important (convert inches to centimeters, or pounds t o kilograms).

### International System (SI) of Units
* A system known as SI from the French name, Système International d'Unitès, has been adopted by many international bodies, including the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, to institute a standard for measurements. In SI, the reference unit for length, mass, and time are meter, kilogram, and second, wit hte symbol m, kg, and s, respectively.
* A multiplier can be used to represent values larger or smaller than the basic unit (gram, liter, meter, etc.). The multipliers are ten raised to a specific power, as listed in Table 1-1. This system avoids the necessity of having different basic units, such as the inch, foot, yard, or ounce, pint, quart, gallon, etc. The multiplier abbreviation precedes the symbol of the base unit with neither a space nor punctuation; an example is m in mL, the mililiter (10^-3 L). Since, for historical reasons, the SI reference unit for mass, kilogram, already has a prefix, multiples for mass should be derived by applying the multiplier to the unit gram rather than kilogram--then 10^-9 kg is expressed in micrograms (10^-6), abbreviated µg.
* Simple units can be combined to produce compound units that can be manipulated algebraically.

Example 1: The unit for volume in SI is the cubic meter (m^3), since

        Volume=length^3=m^3

Example 2: The unit for speed is a unit for length (distance) divided by a unit for time

        Speed = distance/time=m/s

Example 3: The unit for density is the unit for mass divided by the unit for volume:

        Density =mass/volume=kg/m^3

* Symbols for compound units may be expressed in the following formats:

1. Multiple of units. Example: kilogram second

### Other Temperature Scales
CL: K = C +273.15 or C=K-273.15
CL: F=9/5C+32 OR C=5/9(F-32)
