PS: This document is completely written in vim.

The orientation of this topic is listing all the part of an anatomy and inserting general links or notes I can also find on Youtube and on the Internet.

Let's begin!

* **Median Plane**: The median plane is the midline longitudinal plane dividing the head and torso into right and left halves. The presence of the sectioned midline of the vertebral column and spinal cord is characteristic of this plane. Planes parallel  to the median plane are sagittal. Watch out! "Medial" is not a plane.
* **Sagittal Plane**: The sagittal plane is a longitudinal plane dividing the obdy (head, torso, limbs) or its part into left and right parts (not halves). It is parallel to the median plane.
* The **transverse** or **cross plane** divides the body into upper and lower halves or parts (cross sections). This plane is perpendicular to the longitudinal planes. Traverse planes are horizontal planes of the body in the anatomical position.

* Median
* Sagittal
* Coronal Frontal
* Transverse Cross

* **Terms of position and direction** describe the relationship of one structure on/in the body to another with reference to the anatomical position; body standing erect, limbs extended, palms of the hands forward, thumbs directed outwardly.
* **Cranial** and **superior** refer to a structure being closer to the top of the head thahn another structure in the head, nect, or torso (excluding limbs).
* **Anterior** refers to a structure being more in front than another structure in the body. **Vertral** refers to the abdominal side; in bipeds, it is the front of the head or brain that project forward.
* **Posterior** and **dorsal** refer to a structure being more in back than another structure in the body. Dorsal is synonymous with posterior (the preferred term) except in quadrupeds.
* **medial** refers to a structure that is closer to the median plane than another structure in the body.
* **Lateral** refers to a structure that is farther away from the median plane than another structure in the body.
* Employed only with reference to the limbs, **proximal** refers to a structure being closer to the median plane or root of the limb than another structure in the limb.
* Employed only with reference to the limbs, **distal** refers to a structure being farther away from the median plane or the root of the limb than another structure in the limb.
* **Caudial** and **inferior** refer to a structure being closer to the feet or the lower part of the body than another structure in the body. These terms are not used with respect to the limbs. In quadrupeds, caudial clsoer to the tail.
* The  term **superficial** is synonymous with external, the term **deep** with internal. Related to the reference point on the chest wall, a structure closer to the surface of the body is superficial; a structure farther away from the surface is deep.
* **Ipsilateral** means "on the same side" (in this case, as the reference point); **contralateral** means "on the opposite side" (of the reference point).
* The **quadruped** presents four points of direction; head and (cranial), tail end (caudal), belly side (ventral), and back side (dorsal).
