* **Median Plane**: The median plane is the midline longitudinal plane dividing the head and torso into right and left halves. The presence of the sectioned midline of the vertebral column and spinal cord is characteristic of this plane. Planes parallel  to the median plane are sagittal. Watch out! "Medial" is not a plane.
* **Sagittal Plane**: The sagittal plane is a longitudinal plane dividing the obdy (head, torso, limbs) or its part into left and right parts (not halves). It is parallel to the median plane.
* The **transverse** or **cross plane** divides the body into upper and lower halves or parts (cross sections). This plane is perpendicular to the longitudinal planes. Traverse planes are horizontal planes of the body in the anatomical position.

* **Cranial** and **superior** refer to a structure being closer to the top of the head thahn another structure in the head, nect, or torso (excluding limbs).
* **Anterior** refers to a structure being more in front than another structure in the body. **Vertral** refers to the abdominal side; in bipeds, it is the front of the head or brain that project forward.
* **Posterior** and **dorsal** refer to a structure being more in back than another structure in the body. Dorsal is synonymous with posterior (the preferred term) except in quadrupeds.

## Orientation of the body: Systems of the Body (1)
* Collections of similar cells constitute tissues. The four basic tissues are integrated into body wall and visceral structures/organs. A **system** is a collection of organs and structures sharing a common function. Organs and structures of a single system occupy diverse regions in the body and are not necessarily grouped together.
* The **skeletal system** consists of bones and the ligaments that secure the bones at joints.
* The **articular system** comprises both fixed and movable joints.
* The **muscular system** includes the skeletal muscles that moves the skeleton, the face, and other structures, and give form to the body; cardiac muscle pumps blood through the heart; smooth muscle moves the contents of viscera, vessels, and glands, and also moves the hair on skin.
* The **cardiovascular system** consists of the four-chambered heart; arteries conducting blood to the tissues; capiliaries through which nutrients, gases, and molecular material pass to and from the tissues; and veins returning blood from the tissues to the heart.
* The **lymphatic system** is a system of vessels assisting the veins in recovering the body's tissue fluids and returning them to the heart. Lymph nodes filter lymph through the body.
* The **nervous system** consists of impulse-generating/-conducting tissue organized into a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system (nerves). The Peripheral nervous system includes the visceral (autonomic) nervous system, which is involved in involuntary "fight or flight" and vegetative functions.
* The **endocrine system** consists of glands that secrete chemical agents (hormones) into the tissue fluids and blood, affecting the function of multiple areas of the body--not the least of which is the brain. Hormones help maintain balanced metabolic functions in many of the body's systems.
* The **integumentary system** consists of the skin, which is provided with many glands, sensory receptors, vessels, immune cells, antibodies, and layers of cells and keratin that resist environmental factors harmful to the body.

## Orientation to the Body: System of the Body
* The **respiratory system** consists of the upper (nose through larynx) and lower respiratory (trachea through the air spaces of the lungs). Most of the tract is airway; only the air spaces (alveoli) and very small bronchioles exchange gases between alveoli and the lung capillaries.
* The **digestive system** consists of an alimentary canal and glands. It performs the breakdown, digestion, and assimilation of food as well as excretion of the residua. Glands include the liver, the pancreas, and the biliary system (gallbladder and related ducts).
* The **urinary system** is responsible for the conservation of water and maintenance of a neutral acid-base balance in the body fluids. The kidneys are the main functionaries of this system; residual fluid (urine) is excreted through ureters t othe urinary bladder for retention and discharged to the outside through the urethra.
* The **immune/lymphoid system** consists of multiple organs involved in body defence. This system includes a diffuse arrangement of immune-related cells throughout the body; these cells resist invasive microorganisms and remove damaged or otherwise abnormal cells.
* The **female reproductive system** secretes sex hormones, produces and transports germ cells (ova), receives and transports male germ cells to the fertilization site, maintains the developing embryo/fetus, and sustain the fetus until birth.
* The **male reproductive system** secretes male sex hormones, forms and maintains germ cell (sperm), and transports germ cells to the female genital tract.

## Orientation to the Body: Cavities & Lining
CLOSED BODY CAVITIES
* **Closed body cavities** are not open to the outside of the body. Though organs may pass through them or exist in them, their cavities do not open into these closed cavities. Closed body cavities are lined with a membrane.
* The **cranial cavity** is occupied by the brain and its coverings, cranial nerves, and blood vessels. The **vertebral cavity** houses the spinal cord, its coverings, related vessels, and nerve roots. Both cavities are lined by the **dura mater**, a tough fibrous membrane. The dura mater of the vertebral cavity is continuous with the cranial dura at the foramen magnum.
* The **theoracic cavity** contains the lungs, heart, and neighboring structures in the chest. Its skeletal walls are thoracic vertebrae and ribs posteriorly, the rib anterolaterally, and the sternum and costal cartilages anteriorly. The roof of the cavity is membranous; the floor is the muscular thoracic diaphragm. The middle of the thoracic cavity, called the mediastinum, is a partition packed with structures (e.g., heart). It separates the thoracic cavity into discrete left and right parts that are lined with **pleura*8 and contain the lungs.
* The **abdominopelvic cavity**, containing the gastrointestinal tract and related glands, the urinary tract, and great numbers of vessels and nerves, has muscular walls anterolaterally, the lower ribs and muscle laterally, and the lumbar and sacral vertebrae and muscles posteriorly. The roof of the abdominal cavity is the thoracic diaphragm. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are continuous with one another. The pelvic cavity, containing the urinary bladder, rectum, reproductive organs, and lower gastrointestinal tract, has muscular walls anteriorly, bony walls laterally, and the sacrum posteriorly. The internal surface of the abdominal wall is lined by a serous membrane, the **peritoneum**, that is continuous with the outer membrane of the abdominal viscera. The serous secretions enable the mobile abdominal viscera to slip and slide frictionlessly during movement.

OPEN VISCERAL CAVITIES
* **Open visceral cavities** are largely tubular passageways (tracts) of visceral organs that open to the outside of the body, and include the **respiractory tract**, open at the nose and mouth, the **digestive tract** that opesn at both the mouth and the anus, and the **urinary tract** that opens in the perineum at the urethral orifices. These cavities are lined with a mucus-secreting layer (**mucosa)** that is the working tissue of open cavities (providing secretion, absorption, and protection). The mucosa is lined with epithelial cells, and supported by a vascular connective tissue layer and a smooth muscle layer. The male genital tract opens into the lower urinary tract. The femal genital tract opens into the perineum by way of the vagine. Both tracts are lined with mucosae.

* The cell is the basic unit of living structure in the human organism. A body structure more complex than a cell is a collection of cells (tissues, organs) and their products. The activities of cell constitute the life process. What basic life processes are you aware of in the 10 trillion cells of your own bodyÉ
* **Cell organelles**: "little organs"; the collection of membrane-bound functional structures in the cell, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and so on.
* **Cell membrane**: the limiting lipoprotein membrane of the cell. It retains internal structure and permits exportation and importation of materials by infolding/outfolding, as in the formation of pseudopods by white blood cells.
* **Nuclear membrane**: porous, limiting lipoprotein membrane; regulates passage of molecules into and from the nucleus.
* **Nucleoplasm**: the nuclear substance containing chromatin and RNA.
* **Nucleolus**: a mass of largely RNA; it forms ribosomal RNA (RNAr) that passes into the cytoplasm and becomes the site of protein synthesis.
* **Cytoplasm**: the ground substance of the cell excluding the nucleus. Contains the organelles and inclusions (membrane-free collections of lipids, glycogen, and pigments).
* **Smooth/rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**: convoluted, membrane-lined tubules to which ribosomes may be attached (rough ER: flattened) or not. Smooth ER is abundant in cells that symthesize steroids (lipids), such as the liver. It stores calcium ions in muscle.
* **Ribosomes**: the site of protein symthesis, where amino acids are strung in sequence as directed by messenger RNA from the nucleus.
* **Golgi complex**: flattened membrane-lined sacs that bud off small vesicles from the edges of the complex; collects secretory products and packages them for use or export.
* **Mitochondrion**: membranous, oblong structure in which the inner membrane is convoluted like a maze and on which a complex series of reactions take place between oxygen and products of digestion, providing energy for cell operations.

## Cells & Tissues: Tissues Nervous

* **Nervous tissue** consists of neurons (nerve cells) and neuroglia. Neurons generate and conduct electrochemical impulses by way of neuronal (cellular) processes. Neuroglia are  the supporting, nonimpulse-generating/conducting cells of the nervous system. The main, nucleus-bearing part of the neuron is the **cell body**. Its cytoplasm contains the usual cell organelles. Uniquely, the endoplasmic reticulum occurs in clusters called Nissl substance. Neuronal growth consists of migration and arborization of processes. Neurons are the impulse-conducting cells of hte brain and spinal cord (**central nervous system**, or **CNS**) and the spinal and cranial nerves (**peripheral nervous system**, or **PNS**)

#### Types of Neurons
* **Neurons** falls into three structural categories based on numbers of processes (poles); unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar. Processes that are highly branched (arborized) and uncovered are called **dendrites**. They bring impulses to the cell body of origin (of which they are a part). Slender, long, minimally branched processes called **axons** conduct impulses away from the cell body of origin. Within each structural category, there is a great variety of shapes and sizes of neurons. **Unipolar** neurons have, or appear to have (pseudounipolar), one branch that splits near its cell body into a central and peripheral process (sensory neuron of the PNS, lower left). Both processes conduct impulses in the same direction, and each is termed an axon. **Bipolar** neurons have two (central and peripheral) processes (also called axons), conducting impulses in the same direction. **Multipolar** neurons have three or more processes, one of which is an axon. Motor neurons send impulses to other neurons or to effector (skeletal/smooth muscles). Unipolar and bipolar generally coneduct sensory impulses.
* Most axons are enveloped in one or more (up to 200) layers of an insulating phospholipid (**myelin**) that enhances impulse conduction rates. Myelin is produced by **oligodendrocytes** in the CNS and by **Schwann cells** in the PNS. All axons of the PNS are ensheathed by the cell membrances of Schwann cells (neurilemma) but not necessarily myelin. The gaps between Schwann cells are **nodes of Ranvier**, enabling rapid node-to-node impulse conduction. Schwann cells make possible axonal regeneration in the PNS.
* **Neuroglia** exist in the both the CNS and PNS (Schwann cells). **Protoplasmic astrocytes** occur primarily in CNS gray matter (dendrites, cell bodies), **fibrous astrocytes** among the myelinated axons of white matter in the CNS. Their processes attach to both neurons and blood vessels and seem to offer metabolic, nutritional, and physical suport. They may play a role in the blood-brain barrier. Oligodendrocytes are smaller than astrocytes, have fewere processes, and exist near neurons. **Microglia** are the small scanvenger cells (phagocytes) of the brain and spinal cord

## Nervous System; Organization
* The excitable **nervous system** consists of neurons (cell bodies and processes) arranged into a highly integrated central part (**central nervous system** or **CNS** and a more diffuse **peripheral nervous system** or **PNS**). The CNS consists of the brain in the head and the spinal cord in the vertebral column of the torso. The PNS is a vast collection of bundled neuronal processes (nerves) located throughout the body, as well as islands of neuronal cell bodies (ganglia). These neurons are supported by nonconducting neuroglia and a rich blood supply. Neurons of the CNS are inter-connected to form centers (nuclei: gray matter) and long and short axon bundles (tracts: white matter). The brain and spinal cord are packaged in fibrous membranes called meninges.
* The **brain** is the center sensory awareness and movement (except for spinal reflexes), emotions, rational thought and behavior, foresight and planning, memory, speech, language, and the interpretation of the language.
* The **spinal cord**, an extension of the brain, begins at the foramen magnum of the skull, traffics in ascending/decending impulses, and is a center for spinal reflexes. It provides motor commands for muscles and is a receiver of sensory input below the head.
* The PNS consists largely of bundles of sensory and motor axons (nerves) radiating from the brain (**cranial nerves**) and spinal cord (**spinal nerves**), segmentally and bilaterally and reaching to all parts of the body, somatic and visceral, though a highly organized pattern of distribution. **Branches** of spinal nerves are often called peripheral nerves. Nerves conduct all sensations/sensory input from the body to the brain adn spinal cord. Nerves conduct motor commands to all the smooth and skeletal muscles of the body.
* The **ANS** or autonomic (visceral) nervous system is a subset of ganglia and nerves in the PNS dedicated to muscular activity and glandular secretion in organs with cavities (viscera). That is, the ANS is a motor system only; visceral sensations are conducted to the spinal cord and brain by peripheral nerves in the same manner as somatic structures. There are two divisions of the ANS: 1) the **sympathetic (thoracolumbar) division**, responsible for driving fight or flight activities in which the extremes of function are called upon for the sake of safety and survival; and 2) the **parasympathetic (craniosacral) division**, responsible for maintaining vegetative functions of the respiratory tract, ingestion and digestion of food, and disposal of wastes.

## Nervous System: Functional Classification of Neurons
* Neurons generally function in one of three modes: 1) sensory (**afferent**, an alternative term meaning conduction of impulses toward a cnter) neurons receive electrochemical impulses from receptors in the body and conduct those impulses to the central nervous system (CNS); 2) motor (**efferent**, an alternative term meaning conduction of impulses away from a center) neurons conduct motor command impulses from the CNS to muscles of the body; or 3) associative. In the latter, neurons form a network of billions of interconnecting cells with extensive interconnecting processes in the CNS, where these "association" neurons work out all the details between simple sensory input and cimplex motor responses.
* If the sensosry or motor neurons relate to musculoskeletal structures or the skin and fascia (collectively formed from somites in the embryo), the prefix "somatic" may be applied to the term "neuron", as distinguished from "visceral", which refers to organs with hollow cavities that have a fundamentally different origin in the body. Although the sensory neurons of the body wall and viscera are essentially the same, the visceral efferents of these two areas are quite different (somatic efferent vs. visceral efferent, aka "autonomic" nervous system.
* **Sensory neurons** are the afferent side of neuronal interations. They form an association with untold numbers of sensory **receptors** throughout the entire body, including receptors sensitive to touch, pressure, pain, joint position, muscle tension, chemical concentration, and light and sound waves. At any point in time, these receptors collectively provide information on charges in the external and internal environment of and around the body. Most sensory neurons are apprently unipoloar (or pseudounipolar) or bipoloar, based on the numbers of their cellular processes. The **peripheral processes** bring impulses to the cell body and **central processes** conduct impulses into the spinal cord or brain for central processing.
* **Motor neurons** conduct impulses from **cell bodies** located in the CNS through **axons** that leave the CNS and subsequently divide into branches, each of which becomes incorporated into the cell membrane of a muscle cell (**motor end plate**). At the end plate, the neuron releases its neurotransmitter, which induces the muscle cell to shorten. All skeletal muscles require efferent innervation; not cardiac and smooth muscle.
* **Autonomic motor neurons** functions as paired units connected at a ganglion by a synapse. The first or **preganglionic neuron** arises in the CNS, and its axon embarks for a ganglion located some distance from the CNS. There it synapses with the cell body or dendrite of a **postganglionic neuron** whose axon proceeds to the effector organ: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glands.
* **Associated neurons** make up the bulk of the neurons of the brain and spinal cord. Dr. Marian Cleeves Diamond, neuroanatomist and past director of the Lawrence Hall of Science, put it well: "**Interneurons** are responsible for hte modification, coordination, integration, facilitation, and inhibition that must occur between sensory input and motor output. They are the source of the seemingly unlimited array of responses to our environment"

## Nervous System: Neuromuscular Integration
* An axon, and its branches, of a single motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibers it innervates consitute a **motor unit**. The specific connection of an axon with the muscle fiber is called a **neuromuscular junction**. Within any given skeletal muscle, the number of muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron largely determines the specificity of contraction of that muscle. The fewer the number of muscle fibers in each motor unit, the more selective and refined the degree of contraction of the skeletal muscle.
* **Skeletal muscle** consists of innumerable **muscle fibers** (cells). Skeletal muscle requires an intact nerve (innervation) to shorten (contract). Such a nerve, called a **motor nerve**, consists of numerous **axons** of motor neurons. A motor neuron is dedicated solely to stimulating muscle fibers to contract. Each single muscle fiber in a skeletal muscle is innervated by a **branch of an axon**. The microscopic site at which the axon branch attaches to the skeletal muscle fiber is called the neuromuscular junction. Each neuromuscular junction consists of an **axon terminal** closely applied to an area of convoluted muscle fiber sarcolemma called the **motor end plate**. There is a gap between the two surfaces. When a skeletal muscle fiber is about to be stimulated, the axon terminal releases a chemical neurotransmitter, called acetylcholine, into the gap. The neurotransmitter induces a change in the permeability of the sarcolemma to sodium (Na), which initiates muscle fiber contraction. A muscle fiber can only contract maximally ("all or none" law). All muscle cells innervated by the branches of a single motor axon contract maximally.
* Given the fact of "all or none" contractions by individual skeletal muscle fibers, **grades of contraction** of a skeletal muscle are made possible by activating a number of motor units and not activiating others.
* We show here a msucle **at rest** with no motor units activated. Such a condition has two exceptions: 1) receptors responding involuntarily to stretch (muscle spindles) and 2) muscle tone involuntarily set by subcortical motor centers. So, in fact, even among resting muscles, a variable number units are in contraction at any one time even though the muscle is not consciously working.
* In a **partial contraction**, only some of the motor units are activated. In **maximal contraction** of a skeletal muscle, all motor units are activated. The gluteus maxmus consists of skeletal muscle fibers having a nerve-to-muscle ratio of 1:1000 or more. There is no possibility of controlled, refined contractions from this muscle. The facial muscles, in contrast, having a much lower nerve-to-muscle ratio, closer to 1:10. Here small numbers of muscle fibers can be contracted by implementing one or a few motor units, generating very fine control on the muscular effect (facial expression) desired, such as "the Mona Lisa smile".

## Autonomic (Visceral) Nervous System: ANS: Sympathetic Division (1)
* A two-neuron linage uniquely characterizes the **autonomic nervous system (ANS)**, a motor system for smooth muscle, regulation of cardiact muscle activity, and glands (effectors). The main actors are the *preganglionic* and *postganglionic* neurons.
* The autonomic nervous system (ANS) or visceral nervous system (VNS) is part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and consists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The **sympathetic (thoracolumbar) division** is concerned with de-increased heart and respiratory rates, increased blood flow to brain and skeletal muscles, contraction of sphincter muscles, and inhibition of glandular secretion with the exception of sweat glands of the skin. The **parasympathetic (craniosacral) division** is teh "vegetative" division that drives visceral activity (intestinal motility, glandular secretion, etc.) The two divisions work together to achieve internal stability in all phases of life (homeostasis).
* Sensory impulses from viscera are conducted by visceral sensory neurons (GVA) which are equivalent to somatic sensory neurons (GSA). These neurons are not part of the ANS motor system (see glossary, Cranial Nerves, for reference regarding terms GVA, GSA, etc). Impulse conduction through both divisions of the ANS begins with the **preganglionic neuron**. The somata of these neurons are located in the lateral horns of spinal cord segments T1-L2. The preganglionic (myelinated) axons leave the spinal cord through the anterior (motor) roots, travel a short distance in the spinal nerve, then divert to join the **white rami** that take the myelinated fibers to the **sympathetic chain (trunk) of ganglia** running alongside the anterolateral aspect of the vertebral column bilaterally. A **preganglionic axon** can take on of four courses: 1) upon entering the chain, the axon may synapse with a **postganglionic neuron** at that level of synapse, or it may ascend (2) or descend (3) within the chain two or more levels before synapsing. The postganglionic axon will then leave the chain by way of the **gray ramus** at the level of the synpase and join the spinnal nerve. These **postganglionic axons** innervate the smooth muscle in arteries (and some veins) within the distribution pattern of the spinal nerve, and innervate t he sweat glands, arrector pili muscles, and the smooth muscle in the arteries of the skin. The preganglionic axons entering the chain continue out of the chain anteriorly--without synapising--as **splanchinic nerves** 4) heading for ganglia and plexuses of sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons on the anterior wall of the abdominal aorta. The fate of these splanchnic nerves can be seen on the following page.

## Autonomic (Visceral) Nervous System: ANS: Sympathetic Division (2)
* Sympathetic innervation of skin (and viscera as well) begins with the preganglionic neurons in the thracolumbar part of the spinal cord (L1-2). See the left side of the spinal cord diagram. The preganglionic axons leave the cord via the anterior rami of spinal nerves and within a short distance leave the spinal nerves to join the white communicating rami to the sympatetic chain.
* Preganglionic axons ascend, descend, or remain at the same level they entered to synapse with postganglionic neurons destined for the skin. These postganglionic axons leave the chain via the *gray communicating rami*, enter the spinal nerves from C1 through Co1, and reach the skin via cutaneous nerves. These axons induce secretory activity in sweat glands (but not other glands), contraction of arrector pili muscles, and vasoconstriction in vessels except arteries to the head/brain, skeletal muscles, and skin. There are no parasympathetic counterparts to the skin. Nerves to blood vessels ride with spinal nerves and reach t he intended vessels by means of perivascular networks. In sum, sympathetics prepare the body for flight, and if that doesn't work, fight. Established sympathetic activities track this fundamental tenet.
* **Postganglionic neurons** to the head (vessels and glands) leave the superior cervical ganglia and entwine about arteries en route to the head (in the absence of spinal nerves) to reach their target organs. Postganglionics to the heart and lungs leave the upper ganglia of the chain, reaching these organs via the cardia nerves/plexus and the pulmonary plexus. These neurons induce vasodilation of heart muscle, increased heart rate, and bronchial dilation by the local release of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc).
* Preganglionics to abdominal and pelvic viscera leave the cord at Levels T5-L2, enter the white communicating rami, and pass through the sympathetic chain without synapising. They form three pairs (greater, lesser, and least) of **splanchnic nerves** between the chain and the prevertebral ganglia on the aorta. These axons synapse with the postganglionic neurons in the prevertebral ganglia and plexuses, resulting in decreased intestinal motility, tightening of sphincters, and decreased glandular secretion (remember "flight or fight"). They stimulate the adrenal medulla to secrete mostly epinephrine and some norepinephrine. The lowest (sacral) ganglia of the sympathetic chain issue postganglionic axons by way of gray rami (recall: no white rami above T1 or below L2). These ride with somatic spinal nerve axons to the pelvic (and neighboring) plexuses from which the postganglionic axons reach the lower colon, rectum, anal canal, anus, urinary tract in the pelvis/perineum, prostate, uterus, and genital structures, inducing contraction of sphincters, decreasing intestinal motility, relaxing bladder muscles, constricting anal and urinary sphincters, stimulating secretion of male and female genital glands, stikmulating uterine contractions, and contracting perineal and urethral muscles to effect XXXX.

## Autonomic (Visceral) Nervous System: ANS: Parasympathetic Division
* the **parasympathetic**, or craniosacral, **division** of the ANS is concerned with vegetative functions (e.g., encouraging secretory activity by mucous and digestive glands, and dilating sphincters). Functionally, the two divisions of the ANS seem to be essentially polar opposites. On the whole, they work together well, one perhaps with a bit more personality than the other. Still, the peace that comes following a good meal without digestive upset or the relief that follows elimination after a long car ride can be as welcome as being the first to cross the finish line after a grueling run. **Preganglionic neurons**(GVE) arise in the midbrain; joining the **oculomotor (III) cranial nerve**, , these axons enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure to synapse with postganglionic cells in the **ciliary ganglion** of the orbit. The postganglionic fibers project to the posterior eyeball, lary constrictor. Preganglionic neurons (GVE) associated with the facial nerve arise from the brain stem between the pons and eral to the posterior nasal cavity and the nasopharynx), where they synapse with postganglionics in the **pterygopalatine ganglion**. Postganglionic fibers innervate glands of the oral and nasal mucosa as well as the lacrimal gland in the superior and lateral corner of the orbit. Preganglionic neurons (GVE) asssociated with the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) in the upper posterior medullar reach for the otic ganglion by a remarkable route: they go out the jugular foramen, up through the middle ear cavity, piece of the roof of the middle ear cavity, join fibers from the facial nerve to descend into the infratemporal fossa, and synapse with ganglion cells in the otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibers innervate the comparatively large parotid gland (in front of the ear). The GVE fibers of the vagus nerve reach into all quarters from the chest to to the pelvis. The preganglionic fibers are unusally long, descedning the neck from the lwoer brain stem, joining with the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, and running through the posterior mediastinum and esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm to reach the gastrointestinal tract. These preganglionic axons extend as far as the descending colon. The ganglia for these preganglionics are the muscular walls of the organ they supply (**intramural ganglia**). Thus, the postganglionic axons are very short, terminating in smooth muscle and glands.
* The cell bodies of the sacral preganglionic neurons are found in the lateral horns of sacral spinal segment 2, 3, 4 of the spinal cord. Their axons leave the cord via the anterior rami and form their own nerves (**pelvic splanchnics**). These nerves mix with sympathetic postganglionics in the pelvic plexus, and depart from their target organs. They synapse with the postganglionic neurons at intramural ganglia in the organ wall. These fibers stimulate contraction of rectal and bladder musculature and induce vascular dilation in the XXX and XXX.
