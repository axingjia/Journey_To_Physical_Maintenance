PS: This document is completely written in vim.

The orientation of this topic is listing all the part of an anatomy and inserting general links or notes I can also find on Youtube and on the Internet.

Let's begin!

* **Median Plane**: The median plane is the midline longitudinal plane dividing the head and torso into right and left halves. The presence of the sectioned midline of the vertebral column and spinal cord is characteristic of this plane. Planes parallel  to the median plane are sagittal. Watch out! "Medial" is not a plane.
* **Sagittal Plane**: The sagittal plane is a longitudinal plane dividing the obdy (head, torso, limbs) or its part into left and right parts (not halves). It is parallel to the median plane.
* The **transverse** or **cross plane** divides the body into upper and lower halves or parts (cross sections). This plane is perpendicular to the longitudinal planes. Traverse planes are horizontal planes of the body in the anatomical position.

List
* Median
* Sagittal
* Coronal Frontal
* Transverse Cross

===

* **Terms of position and direction** describe the relationship of one structure on/in the body to another with reference to the anatomical position; body standing erect, limbs extended, palms of the hands forward, thumbs directed outwardly.
* **Cranial** and **superior** refer to a structure being closer to the top of the head thahn another structure in the head, nect, or torso (excluding limbs).
* **Anterior** refers to a structure being more in front than another structure in the body. **Vertral** refers to the abdominal side; in bipeds, it is the front of the head or brain that project forward.
* **Posterior** and **dorsal** refer to a structure being more in back than another structure in the body. Dorsal is synonymous with posterior (the preferred term) except in quadrupeds.
* **medial** refers to a structure that is closer to the median plane than another structure in the body.
* **Lateral** refers to a structure that is farther away from the median plane than another structure in the body.
* Employed only with reference to the limbs, **proximal** refers to a structure being closer to the median plane or root of the limb than another structure in the limb.
* Employed only with reference to the limbs, **distal** refers to a structure being farther away from the median plane or the root of the limb than another structure in the limb.
* **Caudial** and **inferior** refer to a structure being closer to the feet or the lower part of the body than another structure in the body. These terms are not used with respect to the limbs. In quadrupeds, caudial clsoer to the tail.
* The  term **superficial** is synonymous with external, the term **deep** with internal. Related to the reference point on the chest wall, a structure closer to the surface of the body is superficial; a structure farther away from the surface is deep.
* **Ipsilateral** means "on the same side" (in this case, as the reference point); **contralateral** means "on the opposite side" (of the reference point).
* The **quadruped** presents four points of direction; head and (cranial), tail end (caudal), belly side (ventral), and back side (dorsal).


## Orientation of the body: Systems of the Body (1)
* Collections of similar cells constitute tissues. The four basic tissues are integrated into body wall and visceral structures/organs. A **system** is a collection of organs and structures sharing a common function. Organs and structures of a single system occupy diverse regions in the body and are not necessarily grouped together.
* The **skeletal system** consists of bones and the ligaments that secure the bones at joints.
* The **articular system** comprises both fixed and movable joints.
* The **muscular system** includes the skeletal muscles that moves the skeleton, the face, and other structures, and give form to the body; cardiac muscle pumps blood through the heart; smooth muscle moves the contents of viscera, vessels, and glands, and also moves the hair on skin.
* The **cardiovascular system** consists of the four-chambered heart; arteries conducting blood to the tissues; capiliaries through which nutrients, gases, and molecular material pass to and from the tissues; and veins returning blood from the tissues to the heart.
* The **lymphatic system** is a system of vessels assisting the veins in recovering the body's tissue fluids and returning them to the heart. Lymph nodes filter lymph through the body.
* The **nervous system** consists of impulse-generating/-conducting tissue organized into a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system (nerves). The Peripheral nervous system includes the visceral (autonomic) nervous system, which is involved in involuntary "fight or flight" and vegetative functions.
* The **endocrine system** consists of glands that secrete chemical agents (hormones) into the tissue fluids and blood, affecting the function of multiple areas of the body--not the least of which is the brain. Hormones help maintain balanced metabolic functions in many of the body's systems.
* The **integumentary system** consists of the skin, which is provided with many glands, sensory receptors, vessels, immune cells, antibodies, and layers of cells and keratin that resist environmental factors harmful to the body.

## Orientation to the Body: System of the Body
* The **respiratory system** consists of the upper (nose through larynx) and lower respiratory (trachea through the air spaces of the lungs). Most of the tract is airway; only the air spaces (alveoli) and very small bronchioles exchange gases between alveoli and the lung capillaries.
* The **digestive system** consists of an alimentary canal and glands. It performs the breakdown, digestion, and assimilation of food as well as excretion of the residua. Glands include the liver, the pancreas, and the biliary system (gallbladder and related ducts).
* The **urinary system** is responsible for the conservation of water and maintenance of a neutral acid-base balance in the body fluids. The kidneys are the main functionaries of this system; residual fluid (urine) is excreted through ureters t othe urinary bladder for retention and discharged to the outside through the urethra.
* The **immune/lymphoid system** consists of multiple organs involved in body defence. This system includes a diffuse arrangement of immune-related cells throughout the body; these cells resist invasive microorganisms and remove damaged or otherwise abnormal cells.
* The **female reproductive system** secretes sex hormones, produces and transports germ cells (ova), receives and transports male germ cells to the fertilization site, maintains the developing embryo/fetus, and sustain the fetus until birth.
* The **male reproductive system** secretes male sex hormones, forms and maintains germ cell (sperm), and transports germ cells to the female genital tract.

## Orientation to the Body: Cavities & Lining
CLOSED BODY CAVITIES
* **Closed body cavities** are not open to the outside of the body. Though organs may pass through them or exist in them, their cavities do not open into these closed cavities. Closed body cavities are lined with a membrane.
* The **cranial cavity** is occupied by the brain and its coverings, cranial nerves, and blood vessels. The **vertebral cavity** houses the spinal cord, its coverings, related vessels, and nerve roots. Both cavities are lined by the **dura mater**, a tough fibrous membrane. The dura mater of the vertebral cavity is continuous with the cranial dura at the foramen magnum.
* The **theoracic cavity** contains the lungs, heart, and neighboring structures in the chest. Its skeletal walls are thoracic vertebrae and ribs posteriorly, the rib anterolaterally, and the sternum and costal cartilages anteriorly. The roof of the cavity is membranous; the floor is the muscular thoracic diaphragm. The middle of the thoracic cavity, called the mediastinum, is a partition packed with structures (e.g., heart). It separates the thoracic cavity into discrete left and right parts that are lined with **pleura*8 and contain the lungs.
* The **abdominopelvic cavity**, containing the gastrointestinal tract and related glands, the urinary tract, and great numbers of vessels and nerves, has muscular walls anterolaterally, the lower ribs and muscle laterally, and the lumbar and sacral vertebrae and muscles posteriorly. The roof of the abdominal cavity is the thoracic diaphragm. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are continuous with one another. The pelvic cavity, containing the urinary bladder, rectum, reproductive organs, and lower gastrointestinal tract, has muscular walls anteriorly, bony walls laterally, and the sacrum posteriorly. The internal surface of the abdominal wall is lined by a serous membrane, the **peritoneum**, that is continuous with the outer membrane of the abdominal viscera. The serous secretions enable the mobile abdominal viscera to slip and slide frictionlessly during movement.

OPEN VISCERAL CAVITIES
* **Open visceral cavities** are largely tubular passageways (tracts) of visceral organs that open to the outside of the body, and include the **respiractory tract**, open at the nose and mouth, the **digestive tract** that opesn at both the mouth and the anus, and the **urinary tract** that opens in the perineum at the urethral orifices. These cavities are lined with a mucus-secreting layer (**mucosa)** that is the working tissue of open cavities (providing secretion, absorption, and protection). The mucosa is lined with epithelial cells, and supported by a vascular connective tissue layer and a smooth muscle layer. The male genital tract opens into the lower urinary tract. The femal genital tract opens into the perineum by way of the vagine. Both tracts are lined with mucosae.
