# Safety
* Though all the designs and methods in this book have been reviewed for safety, it is not possible to overstate the importance of using the safest construction methods you can. What follows are reminders--some doès and donèts of work safety. They are not subsitute for your own common sense.

* Always use caution, care, and good judgment when following the procedures described in this book.
* Always be sure that the electrical setup is safe, that no circuit is overloaded, and that all power tools and outlets are properly grounded. Do not use power tool in wet locations.
* Always read container labels on paints, solvents, and other products; provide ventilation; and observe all other warnings.
* Always read manufacturerès instruction for using a tool, especially the warnings.
* Use hold-downs and push sticks whenever possible when working on a table saw. Avoid working short pieces if you can.
* Always remove the key from any drill chuck (portable or press) before starting the drill.
* Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works so that you can avoid being injured.
* Always know the limitations of your tools. Do not try to force them to do what they were not designed to do.
* Always make sure that any adjustment is locked before proceeding. For example, always check the rip fence on a table saw or the bevel adjustment on a portable saw before starting to work.
* Always clamp small pieces to a bench or other work surface when using a power tool on them.
* Always wear the appropriate rubber or work gloves when handling chemicals, moving or stacking lumber, or doing heavy construction.
* Always wear a disposable face mask when you create dust by sawing or sanding. Use a special filtering respirator when working with toxic substances and solvents.
* Always wear eye protection, especially when using power tools or striking metal on metal or concrete; a chip can fly off, for example, when chiseling concrete.
* Never work while wearing loose clothing, hanging hair, open cuffs, or jewelry.
* Always be aware that there is seldom enough time for your bodyès reflexes to save you from injury from a power tool in a dangerous situation; everything happens too fast. Be alert!
* Always keep your hands away from the business ends of blades, cutters, and bits.
* Always hold a circular saw firmly, usually with both hands so that you know where they are.
* Always use a drill with an auxilary handle to control the torge when large-size bits are used.
* Always check your local building codes when planning new construction. The codes are intended to protect public safety and should be observed to the letter.
* Never work with power tools when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* Never cut tiny pieces of wood or pipe using a power saw. Always cut small pieces off large pieces.
* Never change a saw blade or a drill or router bit unless the power cord is unplugged. Do not depend on the switch being off; you might accidentally hit it.
* Never work in insufficient lighting.
* Never work with dull tools, Have them sharpened, or learn how to sharpen them yourself.
* Never use a power tool on a workpiece--large or small--that is not firmly supported.
* Never saw a workpiece that spans a large distance between sawhorses without close support on each side of the cut; the piece can bend, closing on and jamming the blade, causing saw kickback.
* Never support a workpiece from underneath with your leg or other part of your body when sawing.
* Never carry sharp or pointed tools, such as utility knives, awls, or chisels, in your pocket. If you want to carry such tools, use a special-purpose tool belt with leather pockets and holders.

            * Making accident preventable
            * Making Wiring Safer
            * Dealing with the aftermath

PREPARENESS
* Not every emergency can be prepared for, but if you live in an area prone to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or tornadoes, you should have basic emergency supplies on hand, and your family should be aware of what steps to take when disaster strikes.
* Hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center recommends that those living in low-lying area have an evacuation plan. Find out about the best routes from your local police or Red Cross chapter. Also plan for emergency communication, such as contacting a friend out of the storm area, in case family members are separated. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings, check your emergency supplies, and fuel the car. Bring in outdoor objects such as lawn furniture, and close shutters or install plywood before the storm arrives. Unplug appliances, cut off the main circuit breaker, and turn off the main water-supply valve. If time permits, elevate furniture to protect it against flooding.
* Tornadoes. Have a place ready where you can take shelter--if you don't have a basement, find a windowless spot on the ground floor, such as a bathroom or a closet under stairs. As tornadoes usually happen with little warning, each family member should know the danger signs, where your emergency supplies are, and what to do in case of a power outage or gas leak.
* Earthqueakes. If you live in an earthquake zone, have all shelves fastened securely to your walls, and store heavy or breakable items close to the floor. During an earth-quake, the safety place in your home (according to FEMA) is under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall, away from windows or furniture that may topple.
* Suvival Tips. If you plan to ride out a storm, have basic emergency supplies on hand, including **flashlights and extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, first-aid kit, extra nonperishable food and water, essential medicines, and a cell phone.** Turn the refrigerator to its coldest setting, and open and close it only when necessary. Store drinking water in jugs and bottles--and in clean bathtubs.

SEVERE WEATHER
* Severe storms are quantified by their power and the damage they do--like the Richter scale for the force of an earthquake. Hurricanes, for example, are measured according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which predicts five levels of damage you can expect as storm winds rise from 74 miles per hour (when hurricane warnings are issued) to over 155 mph. Often, it's a combination of wind and rain that causes damage, particularly to roofs.
* Temporary Roof Repairs. It's natural to try to patch an active leak but unwise to work on a wet roof in bad weather. There are exceptions: mainly, if the house has a low-sloped or flat roof that you wouln't roll off even if you slipped. When you can work safely, temporary stem roof leaks with roof cement (not roof coating). On standard shingles, flashing, roll roofing, and even built-up flat roofs, pry apart the leaking seam, and fill the opening with the thick tar. Then push the shingle seam or flashing edge back in place, and add another thick layer of tar on top. If a shingle tab (the exposed section) has blown off, cover the area with tar, particularly exposed nailheads on the shingle layer below, and weave in a cover layer--if you don't have spare shingles, a piece of tarpaper or even a plastic bag will work--to maintain the system of overlapping edges that shed water.
* Clearing Bottlenecks. To help prevent damage, it pays to regularly check and clear gutters and downspouts, particular the S-shaped offset fitting that directs water from roof over hangs back toward the building leader board. These fittings typically are held in place with sheet-metal screws, which you need to remove to gain access for cleaning.
* De-icing. To prevent gutters and drains from becoming laden with ice during a winter strom, you can install UL-approved electric heat cables equipped with built-in thermostats that trigger a power flow when temporatures drop to the freezing point. Once the drainage system freezes, ice dams can form on the roof edge.

        An early storm warning can allow time to pack up essential and batten down the house with plywood or boards.

NO POWER, NO PROBLEM?
* The best way to know what you'll need is to remember what you most missed last time there was an outage. For example, in a house with a well and only a small holding tank, you might miss water more than lights, which can be replaced temporarily by candles.
* Conserving heat. In winter, conserve heat during an outage by making only the quickest entries and exits through exterior doors and opening drapes and blinds to winter sun for solar heat gain during the day. If power goes out at night, drape blankets over windows to provide more insulation. Stay in the warmest room, normally on the south side of the house, and insulate the space from colder areas by hanging blankets over hallways.
* Automatic Lighting. To avoid a maddening search for a flashlight with good batteries, use a recharging flashlight. Leave it plugged into an outlet, and when the power goes off, the light will turn on automatically so that you can see where it is. Remove the unit, and use it as a portable flashlight.
* Portable Generators. A home generator is handy for an area with frequent power outages or for anyone who relies on electricity for their water or heat. To prepare a generator to run your lights and outlets, have an eletrician install a transfer panel at your main service panel (the main circuit-breaker box where electricity enters the house). With this kind of hookup, you can supply limited power through your normal house wiring. Without a transfer panel, you need to string extension cords from the generator and plug the refrigerator, well pump, and a few lights directly into the unit. Remember, never run a gas-powered generator in the house or garage. Its exhaust fumes can be lethal.
* Restarts. Before you resume the normal operation of applicances after a power outage has ended, check the manufacturer's restart instructions. Some, particularly older furnaces and water heaters, may require a specific sequence in order to restart safely.

WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
* The natural impulse after your house is flooded is to remove as much water as quickly as you can. But after a major flood, you should resist the impulse, and drain the water slowly.
* Pumping out water. The hidden danger is that the ground outside the foundation wall is saturated and pressing against the masonry with the potential force of a mudslide. In extreme cases, several feet of water inside the wall pressing in the opposite direction may be the only thing preventing a collapse. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you should wait until water on the ground outside begins to drain away before pumping out the basement. Even then, you should reduce the level only 2 or 3 feet the first day. Remember, don't use a gasoline-powered generator or pump inside the house because it releases deadly carbon monoxide fume.
* Sump Pumps. Vheck your sump pump; it can prevent major damage from flooding. Many models turn on when a float rises along a wire as water rises in the sump hold. If the sump hasn't kicked in recently, the float can seize in place. Run it up and down a few times to make sure that the sump, and everything else in the basement, won't wind up submerged.
* Foundation Repairs. Interior surface patches won't work on foundations because leaks have a wall of water behind them--sometimes massive hydrostatic pressure from a yard of compacted dirt that has turned to mud. But there is one material, hydraulic cement, which has the potential to stem an active leak through masonry. The dense cement mix should be forced into wet cracks, packed in layer after layer, and held in place with a cover board. Even if water continues to flow, the mix will harden and swell as it sets up. If you pack the crack tightly, the swelling mix fills nooks and crannies and can stop the leak
