# Safety
* Though all the designs and methods in this book have been reviewed for safety, it is not possible to overstate the importance of using the safest construction methods you can. What follows are reminders--some doès and donèts of work safety. They are not subsitute for your own common sense.

* Always use caution, care, and good judgment when following the procedures described in this book.
* Always be sure that the electrical setup is safe, that no circuit is overloaded, and that all power tools and outlets are properly grounded. Do not use power tool in wet locations.
* Always read container labels on paints, solvents, and other products; provide ventilation; and observe all other warnings.
* Always read manufacturerès instruction for using a tool, especially the warnings.
* Use hold-downs and push sticks whenever possible when working on a table saw. Avoid working short pieces if you can.
* Always remove the key from any drill chuck (portable or press) before starting the drill.
* Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works so that you can avoid being injured.
* Always know the limitations of your tools. Do not try to force them to do what they were not designed to do.
* Always make sure that any adjustment is locked before proceeding. For example, always check the rip fence on a table saw or the bevel adjustment on a portable saw before starting to work.
* Always clamp small pieces to a bench or other work surface when using a power tool on them.
* Always wear the appropriate rubber or work gloves when handling chemicals, moving or stacking lumber, or doing heavy construction.
* Always wear a disposable face mask when you create dust by sawing or sanding. Use a special filtering respirator when working with toxic substances and solvents.
* Always wear eye protection, especially when using power tools or striking metal on metal or concrete; a chip can fly off, for example, when chiseling concrete.
* Never work while wearing loose clothing, hanging hair, open cuffs, or jewelry.
* Always be aware that there is seldom enough time for your bodyès reflexes to save you from injury from a power tool in a dangerous situation; everything happens too fast. Be alert!
* Always keep your hands away from the business ends of blades, cutters, and bits.
* Always hold a circular saw firmly, usually with both hands so that you know where they are.
* Always use a drill with an auxilary handle to control the torge when large-size bits are used.
* Always check your local building codes when planning new construction. The codes are intended to protect public safety and should be observed to the letter.
* Never work with power tools when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* Never cut tiny pieces of wood or pipe using a power saw. Always cut small pieces off large pieces.
* Never change a saw blade or a drill or router bit unless the power cord is unplugged. Do not depend on the switch being off; you might accidentally hit it.
* Never work in insufficient lighting.
* Never work with dull tools, Have them sharpened, or learn how to sharpen them yourself.
* Never use a power tool on a workpiece--large or small--that is not firmly supported.
* Never saw a workpiece that spans a large distance between sawhorses without close support on each side of the cut; the piece can bend, closing on and jamming the blade, causing saw kickback.
* Never support a workpiece from underneath with your leg or other part of your body when sawing.
* Never carry sharp or pointed tools, such as utility knives, awls, or chisels, in your pocket. If you want to carry such tools, use a special-purpose tool belt with leather pockets and holders.

            * Making accident preventable
            * Making Wiring Safer
            * Dealing with the aftermath

PREPARENESS
* Not every emergency can be prepared for, but if you live in an area prone to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or tornadoes, you should have basic emergency supplies on hand, and your family should be aware of what steps to take when disaster strikes.
* Hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center recommends that those living in low-lying area have an evacuation plan. Find out about the best routes from your local police or Red Cross chapter. Also plan for emergency communication, such as contacting a friend out of the storm area, in case family members are separated. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings, check your emergency supplies, and fuel the car. Bring in outdoor objects such as lawn furniture, and close shutters or install plywood before the storm arrives. Unplug appliances, cut off the main circuit breaker, and turn off the main water-supply valve. If time permits, elevate furniture to protect it against flooding.
* Tornadoes. Have a place ready where you can take shelter--if you don't have a basement, find a windowless spot on the ground floor, such as a bathroom or a closet under stairs. As tornadoes usually happen with little warning, each family member should know the danger signs, where your emergency supplies are, and what to do in case of a power outage or gas leak.
* Earthqueakes. If you live in an earthquake zone, have all shelves fastened securely to your walls, and store heavy or breakable items close to the floor. During an earth-quake, the safety place in your home (according to FEMA) is under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall, away from windows or furniture that may topple.
* Suvival Tips. If you plan to ride out a storm, have basic emergency supplies on hand, including **flashlights and extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, first-aid kit, extra nonperishable food and water, essential medicines, and a cell phone.** Turn the refrigerator to its coldest setting, and open and close it only when necessary. Store drinking water in jugs and bottles--and in clean bathtubs.

SEVERE WEATHER
* Severe storms are quantified by their power and the damage they do--like the Richter scale for the force of an earthquake. Hurricanes, for example, are measured according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which predicts five levels of damage you can expect as storm winds rise from 74 miles per hour (when hurricane warnings are issued) to over 155 mph. Often, it's a combination of wind and rain that causes damage, particularly to roofs.
* Temporary Roof Repairs. It's natural to try to patch an active leak but unwise to work on a wet roof in bad weather. There are exceptions: mainly, if the house has a low-sloped or flat roof that you wouln't roll off even if you slipped. When you can work safely, temporary stem roof leaks with roof cement (not roof coating). On standard shingles, flashing, roll roofing, and even built-up flat roofs, pry apart the leaking seam, and fill the opening with the thick tar. Then push the shingle seam or flashing edge back in place, and add another thick layer of tar on top. If a shingle tab (the exposed section) has blown off, cover the area with tar, particularly exposed nailheads on the shingle layer below, and weave in a cover layer--if you don't have spare shingles, a piece of tarpaper or even a plastic bag will work--to maintain the system of overlapping edges that shed water.
* Clearing Bottlenecks. To help prevent damage, it pays to regularly check and clear gutters and downspouts, particular the S-shaped offset fitting that directs water from roof over hangs back toward the building leader board. These fittings typically are held in place with sheet-metal screws, which you need to remove to gain access for cleaning.
* De-icing. To prevent gutters and drains from becoming laden with ice during a winter strom, you can install UL-approved electric heat cables equipped with built-in thermostats that trigger a power flow when temporatures drop to the freezing point. Once the drainage system freezes, ice dams can form on the roof edge.

        An early storm warning can allow time to pack up essential and batten down the house with plywood or boards.

NO POWER, NO PROBLEM?
* The best way to know what you'll need is to remember what you most missed last time there was an outage. For example, in a house with a well and only a small holding tank, you might miss water more than lights, which can be replaced temporarily by candles.
* Conserving heat. In winter, conserve heat during an outage by making only the quickest entries and exits through exterior doors and opening drapes and blinds to winter sun for solar heat gain during the day. If power goes out at night, drape blankets over windows to provide more insulation. Stay in the warmest room, normally on the south side of the house, and insulate the space from colder areas by hanging blankets over hallways.
* Automatic Lighting. To avoid a maddening search for a flashlight with good batteries, use a recharging flashlight. Leave it plugged into an outlet, and when the power goes off, the light will turn on automatically so that you can see where it is. Remove the unit, and use it as a portable flashlight.
* Portable Generators. A home generator is handy for an area with frequent power outages or for anyone who relies on electricity for their water or heat. To prepare a generator to run your lights and outlets, have an eletrician install a transfer panel at your main service panel (the main circuit-breaker box where electricity enters the house). With this kind of hookup, you can supply limited power through your normal house wiring. Without a transfer panel, you need to string extension cords from the generator and plug the refrigerator, well pump, and a few lights directly into the unit. Remember, never run a gas-powered generator in the house or garage. Its exhaust fumes can be lethal.
* Restarts. Before you resume the normal operation of applicances after a power outage has ended, check the manufacturer's restart instructions. Some, particularly older furnaces and water heaters, may require a specific sequence in order to restart safely.

WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
* The natural impulse after your house is flooded is to remove as much water as quickly as you can. But after a major flood, you should resist the impulse, and drain the water slowly.
* Pumping out water. The hidden danger is that the ground outside the foundation wall is saturated and pressing against the masonry with the potential force of a mudslide. In extreme cases, several feet of water inside the wall pressing in the opposite direction may be the only thing preventing a collapse. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you should wait until water on the ground outside begins to drain away before pumping out the basement. Even then, you should reduce the level only 2 or 3 feet the first day. Remember, don't use a gasoline-powered generator or pump inside the house because it releases deadly carbon monoxide fume.
* Sump Pumps. Vheck your sump pump; it can prevent major damage from flooding. Many models turn on when a float rises along a wire as water rises in the sump hold. If the sump hasn't kicked in recently, the float can seize in place. Run it up and down a few times to make sure that the sump, and everything else in the basement, won't wind up submerged.
* Foundation Repairs. Interior surface patches won't work on foundations because leaks have a wall of water behind them--sometimes massive hydrostatic pressure from a yard of compacted dirt that has turned to mud. But there is one material, hydraulic cement, which has the potential to stem an active leak through masonry. The dense cement mix should be forced into wet cracks, packed in layer after layer, and held in place with a cover board. Even if water continues to flow, the mix will harden and swell as it sets up. If you pack the crack tightly, the swelling mix fills nooks and crannies and can stop the leak

FIRE! ARE YOU SAFE?
* The most important fire protection is a working smoke detector. Next is a fully charged ABC-rated extinguisher you can use against any type of home fire. For fireplaces and stoves, use a special chimney extinguisher. Most look like a road flare. You remove a striking cap, ignite the stick, and toss it into the fireplace or wood stove. It can suppress a fire in the chimney by displacing oxygen needed for combustion with a large volume of noncombustible gas.
* Smoke Detector. If you smoke detector are battery-powered, change the batteries on a set schedule. There are also hard-wired smoke detectors that run off house current (with battery back-ups). Many building codes require hard-wired detectors. Install at least one smoke detector on every level of the home, and one in an open area near bedrooms.
* Chimneys. Have a chimney sweep inspect chimneys, even if you use a fireplace only occasionally. Sweeps have the tools to dislodge hardened creosote, a by-produjct of incomplete combustion that can reignite and start fires. You can make an unlined flue safer with one of the proprietary masonry mix systems that forms a fire-safe shell inside the flue or by running code-approved stainless steel exhaust duct through the chimney.
* Extinguishers. Mount extinguishers near points where fires may start--say, one in the kitchen and one at the entrace to the utility room that houses a gas-fired furnace, water heater, and clothes dryer. Check the pressure dials to make sure extinguishers are fully charged.
* Escape Routes. For maximum safety, particularly with children in the house, make sure you establish an evacuation plan with two ways out of every room, and walk children throough the routes so they know what to do in an emergency.
* Emergency Numbers. Post telephone numbers of local fire, police, and emergency services. Use an extinguisher against small, spot fires, but don't try to fight large, developing fires; leave the house, and call the fire department.

MAKING ACCIDENTS PREVENTABLE
* Every year, 18,000 people are killed by poisonings, falls, and other common household accidents. More than 13 million others are seriously injured at home in preventable accidents. "Preventable" means that you can correct the conditions that lead to accidents--for instance, by storing chemicals, medicines, and other potentially hazardous products in locked cabinets where children can't reach them. One million children under five years old are injured by unintentional poisoning every year. You can also prevent the most dire consequences of threats that you can't eliminate--for example, reducing the possibility of being injured in one of the 800,500 reportable home fires every year by installing smoke alarms.
* Falling Hazards. Reduce the chance of falling by inproving visibility at night with low-wattage night lights near bedrooms, baths, and stairs. Eliminate dark paths to exterior lights with fixtures triggered by timers or motion sensors. Install nonslip mats or tack strips in bathtubs to provide better footing; also install grab bars and handrails. Sand-finish polyurethanes are available for traction on wooden stairs. Brush-finishing concrete improve traction on exterior walks.
* Safety Glazing. Be sure that shower doors and all large glass panels in the home are made of safety glass, which pebbles when broken. A safety-glass mark is permanently etched into the lower corner of every panel.
* Cutoff Valves. Locate and check the operation of the cutoff valves that control the flow of natural gas or propane to appliances such as furnaces and stoves.
* Gas and CO Detectors. As a backup to regular maintenance, install both natural gas and carbon monoxide detectors that can detect leaks of methane and propane. If you smell gas, the safest course is to leave the house immediately and report the leak. All gas utilities provide a 24-hour emergency number.

        One easy way to ensure a supply of clean indoor air is to periodically clean heating and cooling equipment.

MAKING WIRING SAFER
* There are two basic ways to reduce risks when you work on wiring. First, make a circuit map and post it at the main service panel so that you know which breaker to trip. Second, double-check wires and outlets with a neon tester. If the pwoer is off, the tester won't light.
* Built-in Shock Protection. Safety is provided from the point where electricity enters the house and through the network of wiring to appliances it powers. At the service panel, there is a main cutoff, usually a double toggle at the top of the box, that shuts off all power. Next in line are individual circuit breakers inn rows beneath the main cut-off. Each controls a loop of wiring that services a specific part of the house. Some circuits feed several lights and outlets, while others only a single appliance that uses a lot of electricity like a kitchen range.
* GFCIs. More protection against electrical shock is provided by ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) at electrical outlets that are close to sources of water because they are most likely to produce a shock. GFCI outlets are more sensitive than standard circuit breakers and trip instantaneously. GFCIs are required by the National Electrical Code in all new baths, kitchens, laundries, and exterior outlets. Some electrical appliances, including hair dryers manufactured since 1991, are equipped with appliance leakage current interrupters (ALCIs) or immersion detection circuit interrupters (IDCIs), which give extra protection against shock when an appliance is accidentally dropped in water.
* Extension Cords. Permanent wiring systems have many built-in safety features, but extension cords, which are widely used, do not. Check the UL label, and you'll find that there are different types (for inside versus outside use) and different wattage ratings. A standard cord is fine for a lamp with a 100-watt bulb. But plug in a room heater, and the cord can heat up and start a fire. **To be safe, the extension cord wattage rating should be 1.25 times the rating of the appliance.**

        Circuit breakers trip automatically when there is a problem. Reset them once, but if they trip again, call in an electrician.

DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH
* When a severe storm causes damage to your house, you may have to make many temporary fixes, such as covering a leaking roof with a tarp, before the weather improves and you or your contractor can work safely to make permanent repairs.
* Temporary Roof Repairs. When you can work safely, use roof cement to stem leaks. It has a thick consistency and won't run on sloped roofs. use it to fill punctures from tree limbs and to cover nailheads and exposed courses where shingle tabs have been damaged or blown away.
* Releasing Leak Reservoirs. To safely release leak reservoirs in a ceiling, put a big basin under the area, and pop the bulge with one small hole away from the center of the bulge. As that hole drains, make another hold clsoer to the center to release the water gradually.
* Clearing Iced Gutters. A propane torch or a heat gun will melt small blockages in frozen gutters. The most drastic solution is to pull frozen downspouts off the wall. Remember, if gutters and leaders are filled with ice, they will be extremely heavy. Once you pry the downspout loose, stand clear, and let it fall to the ground like a tree. That way, water trapped on the roof and in the gutter can begin to drain away without waiting for the giant icicle in the downspout to melt.
* After a storm. If you return to a damaged home after a storm, enter with caution; beware of animals that were driven to higher ground by flooding. If you smell gas, open a window, lead immediately, and report the leak. If you see sparks or broken electrical wires in a flooded house, do not enter; have the problems fixed by an electrician. Be wary picking through a structurally damaged building. FEMA reports that after one of the most devastating hurricanes of the 1990s (Hurricane Andrew), 18 of the 54 deaths attributed t othe storm occurred after the wather cleared, when some people fell in unsafe buildings or were struck by falling debris.

A SENSE OF SECURITY
* No home ccan ever be made absolutely burglar-proof: if a burglar really wants to get in, even elaborate electronic security systems probably won't stop him. It's a question of degree: not enough protection can be foolhardy, while too much can be overbearing. What makes one person feel safe at home may leave another fearful.
* You can achieve a comfortable level of security in many ways, ranging from taking such commonsense precautions as not advertising your absence, to installing expensive elctronic alarms linked to a security station that monitors them. But some of the most beneficial security measures are relatively simple. Begin by strengthening the most basic defenses you already have, including door locks, window latches, and lights, before adding to your home security arsenal. That way you can make your home more secure without disrupting your day-to-day life--or denting your checkbook.

LOCKING UP
* There's a reason castles were built with moats around them: limiting intruders to one point of entry makes a building easier to defend. The average home, however, provides a dozen or so points of entry: all your doors and windows.
* You need a good lock on the front door, of course, but no burglar will waste time on double dead bolts if you've left a first floor or basement window open a crack for ventilation. It makes more sense to build in a reasonable amount of protection at every point of entry. Windows need locks, and you have to remember to use them when you go out for the evening. If you want to leave a window open a crack for ventilation in hot weather--just install a second lock in the cracked-open position as detailed under "Locking an Open Window".
* Basement windows are especially easy target for burglars; they are so low to the ground it's hard to see anyone breaking in. To make them more secure, you can install scissor-type gates and a lock on the inside of the window or custom-made iron grilles on the outside. A less prison-like solution would be to use glass blocks to replace the windows--you'd lose the ventilation, but not the light.

        While a standard lockset is relatively easy to break through, the dead bolt above is not because it lock the door to the frame.

        This type of keyless lock has a combination cylinder on the dead bolt, and a regular key lock in case you forget the combination

        When a lock sticks or is slow in responding, it may be clogged with dirt. Lubricate the cylinder with penetrating oil.

        If you can't push a key because of ice in the lock, thaw it out with a hair dryer, or heat the key with a match and work it in.

* The cylinders of most locks have the same basic design. Two opposing rows of spring-loaded pins are cut at different lengths so that they align (and you can open the door) only when the pins are shifted into position by a particular key. The system provides reasonable security and convenience. Unfortunately, many burglaries today are kick-ins where the door and jamb are smashed. Long screws that join the jamb and house frame will help; so will a dead bolt. Some codes may not allow dead bolt with an inside key (instead of a thumb latch) because you may have to search for the key in a fire emergency.

        Many people enter through the garage, where computer chips in modern remotes can set new code combinations every day.

        Security Program: In some areas, there are so many false alarm from security systems that police reduce their level of response--or stop responding altogether. Electronic systems are a deterrent, but there is no substituted for high-quality locks on windows and doors, good exterior lighting so that burglar can't conceal themselves, and good neighbors who watch out for each other. A crime watch program, like a security company sticker, may not stop a determined thief but may deter a casual one.

        When a key breaks inside a lock, lift up the broken end with a narrow piece of metal, and remove the stub with pliers.

        Vacation Security: If you have piles of cash in the house, burglars may fight through a pack of rottweilers to get it. But if you cache is like most people's--TVs, steros, and such--most burglars are likely to break in only if they're sure you're not there. Below are several ways to make your home look like a bad risk by simulating normal activity with light timers and other devices--even if you're away on vacation.

        A stuffed mailbox and a pile of newspaper is a clear signal no one's home--have deliveries held while you're away.

        Vacation Checklist
        * Don't close up: Leave signs of normal activity, like a rake on the front lawn
        * Stop deliveries: Don't let mail or newspapers accumulate while you're gone
        * Phone calls: Leave your answering machine on (and clear the messages from your vacation spot) or have your calls forwarded.
        * Outside lights: Put outdoor lights on a timer, photoelectric switch, or motion-sensor switch
        * Inside light: Mimic your normal schedule by putting upstairs and downstairs lights on automatic timers
        * Trigger activity: Put some indoor lights on special switches that turn on when they detect noise or motion--a good idea of lamps located near your front porch.
