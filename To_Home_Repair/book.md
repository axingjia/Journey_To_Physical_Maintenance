# Safety
* Though all the designs and methods in this book have been reviewed for safety, it is not possible to overstate the importance of using the safest construction methods you can. What follows are reminders--some doès and donèts of work safety. They are not subsitute for your own common sense.

* Always use caution, care, and good judgment when following the procedures described in this book.
* Always be sure that the electrical setup is safe, that no circuit is overloaded, and that all power tools and outlets are properly grounded. Do not use power tool in wet locations.
* Always read container labels on paints, solvents, and other products; provide ventilation; and observe all other warnings.
* Always read manufacturerès instruction for using a tool, especially the warnings.
* Use hold-downs and push sticks whenever possible when working on a table saw. Avoid working short pieces if you can.
* Always remove the key from any drill chuck (portable or press) before starting the drill.
* Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works so that you can avoid being injured.
* Always know the limitations of your tools. Do not try to force them to do what they were not designed to do.
* Always make sure that any adjustment is locked before proceeding. For example, always check the rip fence on a table saw or the bevel adjustment on a portable saw before starting to work.
* Always clamp small pieces to a bench or other work surface when using a power tool on them.
* Always wear the appropriate rubber or work gloves when handling chemicals, moving or stacking lumber, or doing heavy construction.
* Always wear a disposable face mask when you create dust by sawing or sanding. Use a special filtering respirator when working with toxic substances and solvents.
* Always wear eye protection, especially when using power tools or striking metal on metal or concrete; a chip can fly off, for example, when chiseling concrete.
* Never work while wearing loose clothing, hanging hair, open cuffs, or jewelry.
* Always be aware that there is seldom enough time for your bodyès reflexes to save you from injury from a power tool in a dangerous situation; everything happens too fast. Be alert!
* Always keep your hands away from the business ends of blades, cutters, and bits.
* Always hold a circular saw firmly, usually with both hands so that you know where they are.
* Always use a drill with an auxilary handle to control the torge when large-size bits are used.
* Always check your local building codes when planning new construction. The codes are intended to protect public safety and should be observed to the letter.
* Never work with power tools when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* Never cut tiny pieces of wood or pipe using a power saw. Always cut small pieces off large pieces.
* Never change a saw blade or a drill or router bit unless the power cord is unplugged. Do not depend on the switch being off; you might accidentally hit it.
* Never work in insufficient lighting.
* Never work with dull tools, Have them sharpened, or learn how to sharpen them yourself.
* Never use a power tool on a workpiece--large or small--that is not firmly supported.
* Never saw a workpiece that spans a large distance between sawhorses without close support on each side of the cut; the piece can bend, closing on and jamming the blade, causing saw kickback.
* Never support a workpiece from underneath with your leg or other part of your body when sawing.
* Never carry sharp or pointed tools, such as utility knives, awls, or chisels, in your pocket. If you want to carry such tools, use a special-purpose tool belt with leather pockets and holders.

            * Making accident preventable
            * Making Wiring Safer
            * Dealing with the aftermath

PREPARENESS
* Not every emergency can be prepared for, but if you live in an area prone to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or tornadoes, you should have basic emergency supplies on hand, and your family should be aware of what steps to take when disaster strikes.
* Hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center recommends that those living in low-lying area have an evacuation plan. Find out about the best routes from your local police or Red Cross chapter. Also plan for emergency communication, such as contacting a friend out of the storm area, in case family members are separated. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings, check your emergency supplies, and fuel the car. Bring in outdoor objects such as lawn furniture, and close shutters or install plywood before the storm arrives. Unplug appliances, cut off the main circuit breaker, and turn off the main water-supply valve. If time permits, elevate furniture to protect it against flooding.
* Tornadoes. Have a place ready where you can take shelter--if you don't have a basement, find a windowless spot on the ground floor, such as a bathroom or a closet under stairs. As tornadoes usually happen with little warning, each family member should know the danger signs, where your emergency supplies are, and what to do in case of a power outage or gas leak.
* Earthqueakes. If you live in an earthquake zone, have all shelves fastened securely to your walls, and store heavy or breakable items close to the floor. During an earth-quake, the safety place in your home (according to FEMA) is under a piece of heavy furniture or against an inside wall, away from windows or furniture that may topple.
* Suvival Tips. If you plan to ride out a storm, have basic emergency supplies on hand, including **flashlights and extra batteries, a battery-operated radio, first-aid kit, extra nonperishable food and water, essential medicines, and a cell phone.** Turn the refrigerator to its coldest setting, and open and close it only when necessary. Store drinking water in jugs and bottles--and in clean bathtubs.

SEVERE WEATHER
* Severe storms are quantified by their power and the damage they do--like the Richter scale for the force of an earthquake. Hurricanes, for example, are measured according to the Saffir-Simpson scale, which predicts five levels of damage you can expect as storm winds rise from 74 miles per hour (when hurricane warnings are issued) to over 155 mph. Often, it's a combination of wind and rain that causes damage, particularly to roofs.
* Temporary Roof Repairs. It's natural to try to patch an active leak but unwise to work on a wet roof in bad weather. There are exceptions: mainly, if the house has a low-sloped or flat roof that you wouln't roll off even if you slipped. When you can work safely, temporary stem roof leaks with roof cement (not roof coating). On standard shingles, flashing, roll roofing, and even built-up flat roofs, pry apart the leaking seam, and fill the opening with the thick tar. Then push the shingle seam or flashing edge back in place, and add another thick layer of tar on top. If a shingle tab (the exposed section) has blown off, cover the area with tar, particularly exposed nailheads on the shingle layer below, and weave in a cover layer--if you don't have spare shingles, a piece of tarpaper or even a plastic bag will work--to maintain the system of overlapping edges that shed water.
* Clearing Bottlenecks. To help prevent damage, it pays to regularly check and clear gutters and downspouts, particular the S-shaped offset fitting that directs water from roof over hangs back toward the building leader board. These fittings typically are held in place with sheet-metal screws, which you need to remove to gain access for cleaning.
* De-icing. To prevent gutters and drains from becoming laden with ice during a winter strom, you can install UL-approved electric heat cables equipped with built-in thermostats that trigger a power flow when temporatures drop to the freezing point. Once the drainage system freezes, ice dams can form on the roof edge.

        An early storm warning can allow time to pack up essential and batten down the house with plywood or boards.

NO POWER, NO PROBLEM?
* The best way to know what you'll need is to remember what you most missed last time there was an outage. For example, in a house with a well and only a small holding tank, you might miss water more than lights, which can be replaced temporarily by candles.
* Conserving heat. In winter, conserve heat during an outage by making only the quickest entries and exits through exterior doors and opening drapes and blinds to winter sun for solar heat gain during the day. If power goes out at night, drape blankets over windows to provide more insulation. Stay in the warmest room, normally on the south side of the house, and insulate the space from colder areas by hanging blankets over hallways.
* Automatic Lighting. To avoid a maddening search for a flashlight with good batteries, use a recharging flashlight. Leave it plugged into an outlet, and when the power goes off, the light will turn on automatically so that you can see where it is. Remove the unit, and use it as a portable flashlight.
* Portable Generators. A home generator is handy for an area with frequent power outages or for anyone who relies on electricity for their water or heat. To prepare a generator to run your lights and outlets, have an eletrician install a transfer panel at your main service panel (the main circuit-breaker box where electricity enters the house). With this kind of hookup, you can supply limited power through your normal house wiring. Without a transfer panel, you need to string extension cords from the generator and plug the refrigerator, well pump, and a few lights directly into the unit. Remember, never run a gas-powered generator in the house or garage. Its exhaust fumes can be lethal.
* Restarts. Before you resume the normal operation of applicances after a power outage has ended, check the manufacturer's restart instructions. Some, particularly older furnaces and water heaters, may require a specific sequence in order to restart safely.

WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE
* The natural impulse after your house is flooded is to remove as much water as quickly as you can. But after a major flood, you should resist the impulse, and drain the water slowly.
* Pumping out water. The hidden danger is that the ground outside the foundation wall is saturated and pressing against the masonry with the potential force of a mudslide. In extreme cases, several feet of water inside the wall pressing in the opposite direction may be the only thing preventing a collapse. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you should wait until water on the ground outside begins to drain away before pumping out the basement. Even then, you should reduce the level only 2 or 3 feet the first day. Remember, don't use a gasoline-powered generator or pump inside the house because it releases deadly carbon monoxide fume.
* Sump Pumps. Vheck your sump pump; it can prevent major damage from flooding. Many models turn on when a float rises along a wire as water rises in the sump hold. If the sump hasn't kicked in recently, the float can seize in place. Run it up and down a few times to make sure that the sump, and everything else in the basement, won't wind up submerged.
* Foundation Repairs. Interior surface patches won't work on foundations because leaks have a wall of water behind them--sometimes massive hydrostatic pressure from a yard of compacted dirt that has turned to mud. But there is one material, hydraulic cement, which has the potential to stem an active leak through masonry. The dense cement mix should be forced into wet cracks, packed in layer after layer, and held in place with a cover board. Even if water continues to flow, the mix will harden and swell as it sets up. If you pack the crack tightly, the swelling mix fills nooks and crannies and can stop the leak

FIRE! ARE YOU SAFE?
* The most important fire protection is a working smoke detector. Next is a fully charged ABC-rated extinguisher you can use against any type of home fire. For fireplaces and stoves, use a special chimney extinguisher. Most look like a road flare. You remove a striking cap, ignite the stick, and toss it into the fireplace or wood stove. It can suppress a fire in the chimney by displacing oxygen needed for combustion with a large volume of noncombustible gas.
* Smoke Detector. If you smoke detector are battery-powered, change the batteries on a set schedule. There are also hard-wired smoke detectors that run off house current (with battery back-ups). Many building codes require hard-wired detectors. Install at least one smoke detector on every level of the home, and one in an open area near bedrooms.
* Chimneys. Have a chimney sweep inspect chimneys, even if you use a fireplace only occasionally. Sweeps have the tools to dislodge hardened creosote, a by-produjct of incomplete combustion that can reignite and start fires. You can make an unlined flue safer with one of the proprietary masonry mix systems that forms a fire-safe shell inside the flue or by running code-approved stainless steel exhaust duct through the chimney.
* Extinguishers. Mount extinguishers near points where fires may start--say, one in the kitchen and one at the entrace to the utility room that houses a gas-fired furnace, water heater, and clothes dryer. Check the pressure dials to make sure extinguishers are fully charged.
* Escape Routes. For maximum safety, particularly with children in the house, make sure you establish an evacuation plan with two ways out of every room, and walk children throough the routes so they know what to do in an emergency.
* Emergency Numbers. Post telephone numbers of local fire, police, and emergency services. Use an extinguisher against small, spot fires, but don't try to fight large, developing fires; leave the house, and call the fire department.

MAKING ACCIDENTS PREVENTABLE
* Every year, 18,000 people are killed by poisonings, falls, and other common household accidents. More than 13 million others are seriously injured at home in preventable accidents. "Preventable" means that you can correct the conditions that lead to accidents--for instance, by storing chemicals, medicines, and other potentially hazardous products in locked cabinets where children can't reach them. One million children under five years old are injured by unintentional poisoning every year. You can also prevent the most dire consequences of threats that you can't eliminate--for example, reducing the possibility of being injured in one of the 800,500 reportable home fires every year by installing smoke alarms.
* Falling Hazards. Reduce the chance of falling by inproving visibility at night with low-wattage night lights near bedrooms, baths, and stairs. Eliminate dark paths to exterior lights with fixtures triggered by timers or motion sensors. Install nonslip mats or tack strips in bathtubs to provide better footing; also install grab bars and handrails. Sand-finish polyurethanes are available for traction on wooden stairs. Brush-finishing concrete improve traction on exterior walks.
* Safety Glazing. Be sure that shower doors and all large glass panels in the home are made of safety glass, which pebbles when broken. A safety-glass mark is permanently etched into the lower corner of every panel.
* Cutoff Valves. Locate and check the operation of the cutoff valves that control the flow of natural gas or propane to appliances such as furnaces and stoves.
* Gas and CO Detectors. As a backup to regular maintenance, install both natural gas and carbon monoxide detectors that can detect leaks of methane and propane. If you smell gas, the safest course is to leave the house immediately and report the leak. All gas utilities provide a 24-hour emergency number.

        One easy way to ensure a supply of clean indoor air is to periodically clean heating and cooling equipment.

MAKING WIRING SAFER
* There are two basic ways to reduce risks when you work on wiring. First, make a circuit map and post it at the main service panel so that you know which breaker to trip. Second, double-check wires and outlets with a neon tester. If the pwoer is off, the tester won't light.
* Built-in Shock Protection. Safety is provided from the point where electricity enters the house and through the network of wiring to appliances it powers. At the service panel, there is a main cutoff, usually a double toggle at the top of the box, that shuts off all power. Next in line are individual circuit breakers inn rows beneath the main cut-off. Each controls a loop of wiring that services a specific part of the house. Some circuits feed several lights and outlets, while others only a single appliance that uses a lot of electricity like a kitchen range.
* GFCIs. More protection against electrical shock is provided by ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) at electrical outlets that are close to sources of water because they are most likely to produce a shock. GFCI outlets are more sensitive than standard circuit breakers and trip instantaneously. GFCIs are required by the National Electrical Code in all new baths, kitchens, laundries, and exterior outlets. Some electrical appliances, including hair dryers manufactured since 1991, are equipped with appliance leakage current interrupters (ALCIs) or immersion detection circuit interrupters (IDCIs), which give extra protection against shock when an appliance is accidentally dropped in water.
* Extension Cords. Permanent wiring systems have many built-in safety features, but extension cords, which are widely used, do not. Check the UL label, and you'll find that there are different types (for inside versus outside use) and different wattage ratings. A standard cord is fine for a lamp with a 100-watt bulb. But plug in a room heater, and the cord can heat up and start a fire. **To be safe, the extension cord wattage rating should be 1.25 times the rating of the appliance.**

        Circuit breakers trip automatically when there is a problem. Reset them once, but if they trip again, call in an electrician.

DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH
* When a severe storm causes damage to your house, you may have to make many temporary fixes, such as covering a leaking roof with a tarp, before the weather improves and you or your contractor can work safely to make permanent repairs.
* Temporary Roof Repairs. When you can work safely, use roof cement to stem leaks. It has a thick consistency and won't run on sloped roofs. use it to fill punctures from tree limbs and to cover nailheads and exposed courses where shingle tabs have been damaged or blown away.
* Releasing Leak Reservoirs. To safely release leak reservoirs in a ceiling, put a big basin under the area, and pop the bulge with one small hole away from the center of the bulge. As that hole drains, make another hold clsoer to the center to release the water gradually.
* Clearing Iced Gutters. A propane torch or a heat gun will melt small blockages in frozen gutters. The most drastic solution is to pull frozen downspouts off the wall. Remember, if gutters and leaders are filled with ice, they will be extremely heavy. Once you pry the downspout loose, stand clear, and let it fall to the ground like a tree. That way, water trapped on the roof and in the gutter can begin to drain away without waiting for the giant icicle in the downspout to melt.
* After a storm. If you return to a damaged home after a storm, enter with caution; beware of animals that were driven to higher ground by flooding. If you smell gas, open a window, lead immediately, and report the leak. If you see sparks or broken electrical wires in a flooded house, do not enter; have the problems fixed by an electrician. Be wary picking through a structurally damaged building. FEMA reports that after one of the most devastating hurricanes of the 1990s (Hurricane Andrew), 18 of the 54 deaths attributed t othe storm occurred after the wather cleared, when some people fell in unsafe buildings or were struck by falling debris.

### Security Basics

A SENSE OF SECURITY
* No home ccan ever be made absolutely burglar-proof: if a burglar really wants to get in, even elaborate electronic security systems probably won't stop him. It's a question of degree: not enough protection can be foolhardy, while too much can be overbearing. What makes one person feel safe at home may leave another fearful.
* You can achieve a comfortable level of security in many ways, ranging from taking such commonsense precautions as not advertising your absence, to installing expensive elctronic alarms linked to a security station that monitors them. But some of the most beneficial security measures are relatively simple. Begin by strengthening the most basic defenses you already have, including door locks, window latches, and lights, before adding to your home security arsenal. That way you can make your home more secure without disrupting your day-to-day life--or denting your checkbook.

LOCKING UP
* There's a reason castles were built with moats around them: limiting intruders to one point of entry makes a building easier to defend. The average home, however, provides a dozen or so points of entry: all your doors and windows.
* You need a good lock on the front door, of course, but no burglar will waste time on double dead bolts if you've left a first floor or basement window open a crack for ventilation. It makes more sense to build in a reasonable amount of protection at every point of entry. Windows need locks, and you have to remember to use them when you go out for the evening. If you want to leave a window open a crack for ventilation in hot weather--just install a second lock in the cracked-open position as detailed under "Locking an Open Window".
* Basement windows are especially easy target for burglars; they are so low to the ground it's hard to see anyone breaking in. To make them more secure, you can install scissor-type gates and a lock on the inside of the window or custom-made iron grilles on the outside. A less prison-like solution would be to use glass blocks to replace the windows--you'd lose the ventilation, but not the light.

        While a standard lockset is relatively easy to break through, the dead bolt above is not because it lock the door to the frame.

        This type of keyless lock has a combination cylinder on the dead bolt, and a regular key lock in case you forget the combination

        When a lock sticks or is slow in responding, it may be clogged with dirt. Lubricate the cylinder with penetrating oil.

        If you can't push a key because of ice in the lock, thaw it out with a hair dryer, or heat the key with a match and work it in.

* The cylinders of most locks have the same basic design. Two opposing rows of spring-loaded pins are cut at different lengths so that they align (and you can open the door) only when the pins are shifted into position by a particular key. The system provides reasonable security and convenience. Unfortunately, many burglaries today are kick-ins where the door and jamb are smashed. Long screws that join the jamb and house frame will help; so will a dead bolt. Some codes may not allow dead bolt with an inside key (instead of a thumb latch) because you may have to search for the key in a fire emergency.

        Many people enter through the garage, where computer chips in modern remotes can set new code combinations every day.

        Security Program: In some areas, there are so many false alarm from security systems that police reduce their level of response--or stop responding altogether. Electronic systems are a deterrent, but there is no substituted for high-quality locks on windows and doors, good exterior lighting so that burglar can't conceal themselves, and good neighbors who watch out for each other. A crime watch program, like a security company sticker, may not stop a determined thief but may deter a casual one.

        When a key breaks inside a lock, lift up the broken end with a narrow piece of metal, and remove the stub with pliers.

        Vacation Security: If you have piles of cash in the house, burglars may fight through a pack of rottweilers to get it. But if you cache is like most people's--TVs, steros, and such--most burglars are likely to break in only if they're sure you're not there. Below are several ways to make your home look like a bad risk by simulating normal activity with light timers and other devices--even if you're away on vacation.

        A stuffed mailbox and a pile of newspaper is a clear signal no one's home--have deliveries held while you're away.

        Vacation Checklist
        * Don't close up: Leave signs of normal activity, like a rake on the front lawn
        * Stop deliveries: Don't let mail or newspapers accumulate while you're gone
        * Phone calls: Leave your answering machine on (and clear the messages from your vacation spot) or have your calls forwarded.
        * Outside lights: Put outdoor lights on a timer, photoelectric switch, or motion-sensor switch
        * Inside light: Mimic your normal schedule by putting upstairs and downstairs lights on automatic timers
        * Trigger activity: Put some indoor lights on special switches that turn on when they detect noise or motion--a good idea of lamps located near your front porch.

### Security Basics

WHAT LOCKS DO
* Good locks help keep the honest people honest and provide you with a sense of security on a dark and rainy night. Of course, burglars know plenty of ways to defeat even the best locks. But jimmying a locked door or smashing a window can be noisy or take too long to do--either of which may convine an intruder to look elsewhere for a less risky target.

DOOR LOCKS
* The easiest type of standard door lock for a burglar to open is a key-in-knob lock. These are the locks that can be opened with a credit card: just slip the card between the strikeplate and the spring latch to pop it open. Some of these locks have a separate tongue on the latch that makes this more difficult. But the lock can still be easily stripped out with a screwdriver, or simply removed from the door.
* To give would-be intruders more trouble, attach a separate dead-bolt latch above the existing lockset, or remove the old knob and reinstall a stronger lockset, on eiwht a full mortise dead bolt or spring-latch rim lock. The rim lock is easier to install than a dead bolt and somewhat stronger but has a clunky appearance. The dead bolt is hidden from view.

        passage locksets that have no key are commonly used on interior doors where there is no need for security

        Standard keyed locksets used on exterior doors have a key cylinder on the outside and a thumb latch inside.

        Combination locksets may have a separate latchset and dead bolt, or they can be connected on the same face hardware

        Dead-bolt locks make any key-lock door more secure by connection the door to the frame with a long-throw bolt.

        Exterior keyed locks come with many types of handles, including lever types that are easier to use for people with disabilities.

LOCKING AN OPEN WINDOW
* On windows, permanent locking clips and screws are no help if you want an occasional breath of fresh air; window locks need to be secure yet allow at least some ventilation. You can solve this problem with proprietary hardware or some do-it-yourself installations.
* On a double-hung window, the plan is to lock the two sashes together in a partly opened position--say, with the upper sash cracked 2 inches. To make your own lock, set the sash in a vented position, then drill a hole through the frame of the inner sash and three-fourths of the way into the outer sash where they overlap. The two frames then can be joined solidly but temporarily by a dowel or a common nail.
* Several manufacturers also offer more attractive alternatives, such as elegant brass-capped sash bolts. A small, threaded receptacle fits into, but not through, the outer sash. It accepts a 2 1/4-inch-long threaded bolt that slips through a corresponding hole in the inner sash.

        The rotating lever lock slides under the adjacent housing on the outer sash to join the two sections together.

        The rotating cam lock is harder to pick from the outside because it clips around the housing on the outer sash.

        Keyed window locks are secure, but can be inconvenient if you need to fin and use a key everytime you want some ventilation.

        This window lock increase security with a small stop that prevents the lock from turning unless you squeeze the handle

        The sash lock has a stub that travels in a slotted bracket. In this position, the stub is out of the way so the sash opens.

        Sliding-Door Locks: The typical in-line lock on sliding doors can't offer the degree of security that a lockset provides on a swinging door. The best bet is a bar lock. One end is hinged t othe far jamb and can fold down out of the way when you're using the door. The other side folds down into a U-shaped bracket on the sliding panel and is pinned there with a small key. You can also install a sliding bolt lock that ties the movable panele to the fixed panel. Fixed panels should be permanently clipped to the door frame.

        Installing a Peephole
        * Use a sharp bit to drill a centered eye-level hole the same diameter as the cylinder of the peephole.
        * A typical peephole has an eyepiece attached to a cylinder that goes through the door and screws to a cover plate.


### Door & Window Locks
Doors & Jambs
* A good place to start making your home more secure is the point that a burglar is most likely to attack: the door. Invest in strong locks, but remember that locks only make a connection between exterior doors, which are pretty solid, and doorjambs, which aren't. An intruder may not bother to pick or drill through an expensive dead-bolt lock when one swift kick can break loose the doorjumb that holds the dead bolt keeper. The entire assembly may stay securely locked while swinging into the room with the jamb. You can fix this weak link in your household security by making the door frame part of the building frame, as shown at right in "Strengthening Frames".

        Strengthening Frames
        Use: pry bar, power drill/driver. Shims, wood screws
        1. Prevent kick-in entries where burglars crash in the door and jamb with the lock intact. First, remove the trim.
        2. Insert blocks of wood at several points into the gaps between the door casing and the house wall framing.
        3. Remove the stop or weatherstripping so you can drive screws through the door casing and blocks into the house frame.
        4. Use screws long enough to reach at least 1 in. into the nearest wall stud. Replace the stop to conceal screwheads.

Installing a Dead Bolt
1. use the paper template provided with the deadbolt to mark the center point of the holes you will need to drill.
2. Bore a hole in the door face using a hole saw. When the tip breaks through, drill from the other side to prevent tearout.
3. Bore a hole in the door edge to the latch bolt. To keep the drill (and the hole) level, it helps to sight along the drill.
4. Set the latch bolt in its hole, and make a tracing of the latch plate on the door edge with a utility knife.
5. Chisel out a mortise to match the size and depth of the latch plate. Turn the chisel over to clean the bottom of mortise.
6. Insert the latch bolt (this one being for a new dead bolt) on the door edge, and fasten it in place with the screws.
7. Install the lock cylinder by sliding the metal extension bar, called a tang, through the latch mechanism.
8. To line up t he bolt keeper on the jamb, color or chalk the end of the bolt, close the door, and turn the lock to make an imprint.
9. For maximum security, install a heavy gauge keeper using screws long enough to reach into the house framing.


### Security Systems

WIRED FOR SECURITY
* For most people, alarm systems should be considered only a last resort. A good system is very expensive, often requiring monthly monitoring fees, and you will still need other security measures, such as window locks.
* Too often, elaborate alarms have also one of two undesirable by-products: they either produce a false sense of security because no single system can keep out a determined burglar, or they become a nuisance--because of all the arming, disarming, and false alarms. That only makes you overly security-conscious and more fearful than you reasonably need to be.

TYPES OF ALARM SYSTEMS
* Alarm systems are either wired directly into your house's electrical system or are radio-controlled. A radio system uses battery-powered transmitters to send alarm signals to the master control unit. For a wired system, you need to loop wiring to and from each component of the system. A radio-controlled system is much easier to install but more expensive, and the batteries must be checked periodically.
* Sensors installed at entry points in your home feed signals to the mast control panel. Typical sensors are magnetic switches set on door-jambs or first-floor window sashes; trap switches that string across an air-conditioner or casement window; metal-foil alarm tape that detects movement in a window, motion sensors, and sensors that can detect the sound of breaking glass.

        Basic System Layout
        * Glass-break detector
        * Siren
        * Contact Sensor
        * Control Panel
        * Infrared Sensor
        * Smoke Detector
        * Motion Detector

        Common Components
        * A whole-house security system may include dozens of components, including inside and outside sensors and alarms.
        * Sensor packages at a window can be wired or remote. When a connection between units is broken, the alarm sounds.
        * Remote sensors also work on doors. A wired alternative, a plunger switch in teh jamb, releases when the door is opened.
        * Many whole-house systems include a remote trouble switch--a panic button--that can trigger an alarm from any room.
        * One economical alternative to a detector at every window is a centrally located audio unit that detects glass breaks.
        * Motion detectors are installed inside  to signal movement in rooms and outside to trigger lights. Their range is adjustable.

        Auto-Dialers
        * Some security systems offer off-site monitoring or some other way to respond to an emergency, even if you're not home. When an alarm is triggered at your house, it shows up at the security company's monitoring station. One alternative to this is an auto-dialer. When a security system sensor is triggered, the auto-dialer automatically calls the telephone numbers that you programmed it to call. Any auto-dialer that uses regular phone lines (that is, nonwireless) won't work when lines are down.
        * Caution: Before investing in an expensive security system that automatically reports trouble to local authorities, check with local police about their policy on false alarms. In some areas, the police may not have the manpower or the budget to cover every alarm. There may be a penalty for repeated violations. In some cases, police may not respond at all after there have been a certain number of false alarms from the same address.

        Remote Sensors
        * Remote sensors are like wireless phones. They do the same job as standard security-system components, but they broadcast trouble to the central control panel instead of relaying it by wires strung through your house. Remote sensors make installation easy in an existing home where it may be difficult to conceal wiring. Most types of sensors are available as remote units, including motion detectors and sensors that monitor glass breakage and basement flooding.
        * A remote sensor has circuitry to monitor entry at windows and doors, for example, and battery power to signal entry.
        * Many remote sensors are barely noticeable (only twice the size of a quarter) and do not require hard-wire connections.

### FIRE SAFETY

PREVENTING & DETECTING
* Many house-fire tragedies that make the news could have been prevented. But because the possibility of one's own house burning down seems so remote, many homeowners don't take even the most basic preventitive measures. Many are surprisingly simple and inexpensive, yet very effective at saving both lives and properties

Smoke Detectors
* Smoke detectors may be the most cost-effective consumer product on the market. Just consider what it costs (about $25 for a battery model) and what it can do (provide a warning in enough time to save lives). Detectors should be installed on every level of a home, high on the walls or on ceilings in open areas like hallways. Because deaths are most likely from fires that start at night when everyone is asleep, it's important to install detectors in halls just outside bedrooms. Many building codes now require hardwired units (with battery backup) for new construction and major remodeling.

Heating Equipment
* Regular checkups are the best preventative measure for your heating system. Annual tune-ups are recommended for oil-fired furnaces; once every 3 years for gas-fire units. Electric units, which do not produce any combustion by-products, normally do not need regular tune-ups.
* If you burn wood or coal regularly, have the flue cleaned annually by a chimney sweep. Wood and coal combustion in a stove is dirtier than other types of heating--you need the sweep because the worse hazards are out of sight: creosote, a gummy and flammable product of wood combustion that collects inside the chimney, and cracks in the chimney liner or bricks, which could let smoke and fire escape.

Escape Routes
* Fire departments call it an alternative means of egress--a second way out of a room. On the first floor you could climb out a window. On second stories, you may need a portable safety ladder with metal arms that hang on the window sill and steps that unroll to the ground below. It's important to go over escape routes with children and practice using the escape routes.

        Battery-Powered Detectors
        * Each year, more than 3,700 people die in over 400,000 residential fires. The best way to prevent property damage and injury is to install smoke detectors. About 90 percent of U.S. households have at least one, but up to 16 million detectors don't work, due mainly to dead or missing batteries. You should test battery-powered units monthly, and replace batteries that are low on power. Many building codes require hardwired units that are equipped with battery backup.
        * Most safety organization recommend that you change the batteries in your smoke detector at least once a year.

        Typical Detector Location
        * Living room
        * Basement Stairs
        * Kitchen (Away from Stove)
        * Bedroom
        * Top of Stairs

        Hard-wiring a detector
        * Use: Circuit tester. Combination tool. Screwdriver. Drywall saw, plier. Hard-wired smoke detector
        1. The most convenient power source is a junction box mounted to a ceiling joist. Cut power to the box before opening it.
        2. Check your local codes before running a new supply line from connectors in the junction box to the detector mounting box
        3. Most hardwired detectors have a surface mounting plate that attaches to the electrical box above the drywall.
        4. Following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer, join the detector leads to the power-supply cable.
        5. The leads are attached to a harness that plugs into a receptable on the detector. Twist the detector onto the mounting plate.

        Home Fire Extinguisher
        * Most homes need at least two extinguishers: a small unit in the kitchen and a larger, wall-mounted unit (generally installed in a closet) t o use elsewhere. To avoid confusion in an emergency, choose A-b-c rated units, which work on all types of fires. To use a n extinguisher effectively, remember the acronym P A S S, Pull (the pin), Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep.
        * use an all-purpose A-B-C extinguisher against paper, grease, and electrical firs. Aim at the base of the fire.

        Typial Clearance Codes
        * Hearth. 18''
        * 36''
        * Exhaust Pipe
        * Spacer
        * 9''
        * Fireproof Material 18''

        Chimney
        * 3' Min Above Roof
        * 10'
        * 2' Above the highest Point within 10'

        Safety Checklist
        * Don't overload: Don't not plug more than one heat-producing devfice into an outlet
        * Maintain smoke detector: Replace battery and vacuum the unit annually; test a detector monthly, and replace it every 10 years.
        * Provide safe egress: Have two ways out of every room--a door and a code-compliant egress window--including rooms in finished basements.
        * Fire-safe security: Don't use security locks, bars, or devices that make it difficult to escape a fire.
        * Clean your chimney: Have wood-burning chimneys inspected annually and cleaned as needed.
        * Store inflammables safely: Store inflammable liquids in original containers with tight-fiting lids. Keep them away from heat sources or flames, preferrably in a shed.
        * Be prepared: Keep an extinguisher handy to stop a small fire from spreading. In other cases, call 911.

### CHILDPROOFING

Danger At Knee Level
* Don't put off babyproofing your house until the little one can walk--a fast-crawling baby ccan find plenty of trouble. Crawl around your house yourself, and you'll discover many dangerous things at infant eye level: outlets, rickety TV stands, appetizing potted plants. And when a toddler learns to stand, he or she will hold onto anything to get upright, including the tablecloth dangling from a table full of bone china.

Storing hazardous Item Safety
* Any potentially harmful item should be either locked away or kept in cabinets and drawers with childproof safety latches. This includes knives and the obvious poisons such as medicine and cleaning products, but also mouthwash, shaving cream, perfume, and deodorant, which can be harmful to curious toddlers who like to put things in their mouths. Even high counters are not necessarily safe places; you need to put away that decorative knife rack because toddlers will figure out a way to get up on a counter well before you think they can. It's a good idea to have one cupboard or drawer full of safe distractions, such as plastic onctainers or wooden bowls, that a toddler can get to.
* Leave small appliances unplugged, and store them as far out of reach as possible. Plastic bags and plastic wrap also need to be kept in a high place. When discarding plastic bags from dry cleaning, recycle them at the dry cleaner's or tie them into knots before tossing. Buy garbage cans with secure lids that kids can't open.

Keeping Room Safe
* Get safety gates to close off stairs or any room where you don't want the baby to go and you don't have a door to lock. Guards or gates are also needed to keep them away from fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, or space heaters.
* One door lock that kids figure out quickly is the push button on bedroom and bathroom doors. For bathrooms, an adult-height bolt would be a better option for a house with young children. You won't have time to look for a bobby pin to unlock the door if your child slip in the bathtub.


        Built-In Feature
        * Remove one source of accidents on decks (raised nails) with hardware that allows you to fasten boards from below. (Decking, deck nailer, joist)
        * Codes control spacing (often only 4 in.) between parts of stairs and railing so that children can't get caught between them (Baluster, spacing to code)
        * Unlike standard sheet glass that breaks into razor-sharp shards, tempered safety glass breaks into pebble-like pieces (safety glass)

        Openings
        * Safety grates can prevent falls. Building code will not allow lock if the window is a potential fire-escape route.
        * Safety gates can prevent accidents on stairs and wall off rooms. This model has mesh panels that won't trap children.
        * Reduce the risk of accidents with landscaping tools and material by walling them off with a hinged lattice gate.

        Soft Surfaces
        * To reduce noise transmission through the floor and take the edge out of falls, install wall-to-wall carpet over a thick pad.
        * This cushioned chair rail for a child's room has thick foam stapled around a strip of plywood and covered with fabric.
        * On furniture where you can't create cushion surfaces, you can at least reduce hard edges using a roundover bit and router.

        Hazardous Materials
        * Where you can't remove all hazardous materials from children reach, lock up the cabinets that contain them (Safety Catch: U-Sharped Bar, Locking Clip)
        * There are locks to fit every type of door and cabinet combination, including hasp locks that can't be opened with a key (Key Lock: hasp, hinge, cam)
        * Where only minimal security is needed, this under-counter spring lock will keep a door from opening fully (Bar Lock: Countertop, shaft, catch)

        Electricity
        * Short cords are inconvenient on counter-top appliances, but they keep the wires from hanging within the reach of children
        * To eliminate shock hazard when an electrical outlet is not in use, plug a plastic insulator cap into the receptacle.
        * Required by code in many locations, circuit-breaker outlets (ground-fault circuit interrupters) reduce shock hazards.

### ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Bad Air & More
* If you are a nonsmoker or allergic to dust, you can tell as soon as you walk into a room that these common pollutants are present. But some air pollutatns can be harder to identify: fumes from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and high levels of carbon monoxide are prime examples.

VOCs
* VOCs are released as gases from many ordinary products, including wood finishes, paints, adhesives, rug and oven cleaners, dry-cleaning fluids, furnishings, and office equipment. Some (not all) VOCs have a distinct odor, and some (not all) products containing VOCs come with caution labels.
* Health problems resulting from exposure to VOCs include skin rash, upper respiratory irration, nose bleed (from formaldehyde glues), headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness. Because VOC emissions are greatest in new materials and gradually dissipate, symptoms are likely to be triggered during or shortly after remodeling and cleaning work.
* At home, there are several things you can do to reduce your exposure. Meet or exceed label cautions for ventilation when using products that emit VOCs. Don't store opened containers of paint and other materials containing VOCs in the house. To reduce emissions from composite boards used in some cabinets, seal the interior surfaces with two coats of polyurethane.

Carbon Monoxide
* Carbon monoxide (CO) gas is made whenever fuels such as gas, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal are burned. A property used (and maintained) stove or heating appliance won't leak significant amount of the gas. But CO poisoning is tricky to detect, and the initial symptoms (dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath) are easily mistaken for other illnesses. The best preventative measure is to have heating appliances inspected annually by a professional. CO detectors are widely available but should only be used as a backup for yearly maintenance. Performance of these detectors varies widely and because CO is colorless and odorless, it's easy to think the real thing may be a false alarm.

##### Lead Paint
* Many house paints made bfore 1978 contain lead, which is a threat to children and can cause permanent brain damage, behavioral problems, and other serious health problems. If you live in a pre-1978 home, you should contact the EPA National Lead Information Center (800-424-LEAD) or epa.gov/lead) for free information on testing and safety precautions and for guidelines on whether the paint should be left alone, covered, or removed.

        *You can test existing paint for lead with a simple kit. Following instructions, scrape the surface, apply the activator, and wipe.
        *The activator makes a liquid sample on the swab that you then apply to the test card, to find out the lead-content reading.

##### Lead in Water
* Sources of lead in drinking water include lead pipes (common until around 1930), brass faucets or fittings that contain some lead, or copper pipes soldered with material containing lead. If you suspect lead in your water, have the water tested. To reduce the lead you may be consuming, use cold water for consumption (because it doesn't sit in pipes for long), and run the tap 1 or 2 minutes before you drink You may have to replace old pipes.

        * To take a sample of water for testing, first use the flame from a match to burn off impurities on the faucet head.
        * Fill a small, clean container with a sample, which can be tested by some town health departments or a private lab.

##### Radon
* Radon (a colorless, odorless gas) is the second-leading cause of lung cancer. This naturally occurring gas comes from the ground, well water, and some building materials. Nearly one out of every 15 homes contains high levels. It's easy and inexpensive to test your home or well for radon. Indoor levels of 4 picocuries per liter or more need to be fixed. Contractors can install an air-pumping system that vents radon from the ground under your house to the outside (For more information, contact epa.gov/radon.)

LIST
Subslab Ventilation: Pipe, Grade, Rim Joist, To Fan

        A radon test kit conists of a small canister that you leave in your living area. You mail it to a lab for results.

##### Asbestos
* Asbestos is often found as insulation and fire protection on pipes. You also may find asbestos in old cement roofing and siding shingles, insulation (in houses built between 1930 and 1950), walls and floors around wood-burning stoves, and hot-water or steam pipes in older houses. The safest solution is usually to leave it undisturbed--asbestos material in good shape won't release fibers. If you need to remove it, hire a state-licensed abatement contractor.

        LIST
        -Wrapping Asbestos
        - 3-4'' DIA. Cast-Iron Pipe
        - Duct Tape Seam
        - Foil
        - Asbesto

        Asbesto was often used to insulate heating pipes in old homes. You should test a sample before deciding on removal.

##### Gas
* A natural- or propane-gas leak is detectable due to mercaptan, an additive in gas that has a rotten-egg smell. If you suspect a gas leak, the safest course is to leave the house immediately and report it to 911 and the utility's emergency in a gas-fired appliance but don't smell the aroma of a major leak, you can turn off the gas valve near the appliance or the main valve at the gas meter.

        LIST
        -Shutting off gas
        -Pliers
        -Shuttoff value handle
        -Gas Meter

        Specialized plug-in natural gas alarms can detect small amounts of leaking methane and propane in your house.


### UNIVERSAL DESIGN

UNIVERSAL DESIGN
* Making homes accessible for disabled people was once considered an extra that added to the cost of building it. But the trend in residential design today is to include features that make a building accessible for a disabled person and easier and more convenient for anyone else, too. It's called accessible or universal design. Here are some of the basic principles that can be incorporated into new construction and remodeling projects.

ENTRANCE & FLOOR LEVEL
*  Even in single-story homes, level changes are common at the entrance becaues the floor level is generally higher than ground level. There are a few good ways to eliminate this barrier without sticking a wood ramp on the front of the house. One is to create a gradually bermed, or earth-ramped, entrance with landscaping timers.
* In new construction, you can lower the foundation or floor level. Typically, the foundation is several inches aboveground; the first floor is a foot or so higher than that. But when building a home, you stop the foundation at grade and use a combination of pressure-treated plywood sheathing and a waterproofing barrier to prevent leaks at the critical transition between foundation and frame. Another way to reduce floor height is by creating a ledge in the top inside of the foundation equal to the depth of the floor framing. To reduce the chance of damage from wood rot if water seeps in, the joists can be set onto metal hangers attached to a pressure-treated ledger board bolted to the foundation.

OTHER FEATURES
* There are other universal-design alternatives to standard architectural details. For example, a round, easily grasped stairway banister makes a safer, more convenient handrail than the typical 2x6 wood cap piece that is too wide to hold onto firmly. Another design defect is common to by-passing closet doors and cabinets: inset pulls. These pulls put even more stress on finger joints than round knobs. Instead of applying the strength of your whole arm, these pulls focus all the stress on the ends of your fingers. D-shaped pulls with at least 1 and 1/2 inches of clearance to the door surface make the job easier.

##### ACCESS
* Hallways: 48'' min. (MY: between the opposite wall and the opening door's edge)
* Ramps: Ramp 30' max, (-MY: length) 12'', 60'' min. slope 1% max
* Railings: 42'' min, (-MY: wide), 30-32''

### Kitchens
* Stove Clearance: 21'' max. (-MY: depth) Front controls, buners staggered.
* Sink Clearance: 21'' max (-MY: depth), 21'' min. and 34'' max 
* Table Clearance: 30'' (-MY: width), 48''(-MY: as whole)

### Planning
* When you're lounging in the new family room, finally free of whining saws and paint fumes, it may seem incredible that such a complicated remodeling project began on the back of a napkin. But that's the way many jobs start--with a simple sketch. The question is how to develop the idea into a plan that balances what you want, what you need, and what you can afford.
* Not every homeowner is up to the task of developing home-improvement dreams into working blueprints. But the more information you gather and the more details you give a remodeling contractor, the more likely you are to get a reasonable version of what you want at a reasonable price. And that's the final measure of a successful project. The work may cost more and take longer than you imagined. But if you can transform the heart of your first sketch into long-awaited extra living space, you'll find that the hassles tend to fade.
* There are some nightmare jobs. But talk to friends and neighbors who have lived through a major project, and you'll find that most report their own take of the same basic experience. They may grumble about the delays and disruptions--and the money, of course--but then they'll want to take you on a guided tour through the new addition. To reach that position, your ideas must be on paper in the form of measured drawings. You need them to get realistic estimates, to get a building permit, and to pin down construction details for your contractor. Although there are many variations, you have three basic options: hire a design professional, work with a design-build construction firm, or draw your own.

        Every home is different, but most successful remodeling jobs follow a siilar course. Here is the process from a winter start to a fall finish, with pictures from a major overhaul.

DESIGN PROFESSIONALS
* Both interior designers and architects must meet standards and follow guidelines set by professional societies. They work for you and can represent your interests with workers and suppliers. They can come up with a plan, help you analyze estimates, select a contractor, and follow through with regular checkups on materials, schedules, payments, and job quality.
* Although there are exceptions, interior designers, true to their title, are likely to give more attention to the surface than the structure, while architects take it in reverse. This built-in bias is reflected in their drawings: full-color perspectives from interior designers and measured blueprints from architects. That means an interior designer may be the best choice if you need a lot of ideas about remodeling an existing space, and an architect may be better choice if you need to reshape the building.
* Despite some controversy about who can legally use the word "design" to describe their services, design-build firms are an attractive option because they offer a complete package. On a kitchen remodeling job, you may be able to view dozens of designs on a computer screen and get detailed plans, plus cabinets annd installation. Some firms have an architect or engineer on staff for more comprehensive jobs, while others work with code-approved plans that can be modified to suit your needs. Whatever the circumstance, you deal with one company instead of an array of design professionals and independent contractors. That's good, because one party is responsible for every phase of the job. But if problem develop, there is no intermediary to sort things out.

DO-IT-YOURSELF PLANS
* **It's a good idea to develop your ideas in detail, even if you turn to an architect or design-build firm to complete the final version. This preliminary planning will refine your best dieas and weed out the worse variations.** You can work from stock designs in plan books and, in some areas, use preapproved plans supplied by the building department for basic projects such as decks. Stealing ideas from the pages of shelter magazines that show materials and designs you like, and survey displays in local home centers. It helps to see materials firsthand instead of in a catalog where the scale can be deceiving.
* **Sketch out a basic floor to scale on graph paper, and use models to approximate furniture--or use home-design computer software to work up your plans. Even basic programs allow you to try different furniture arrangements and change materials with the click of a mouse. But it pays to test your plan at full scale--for example, by laying out the lines of a new deck with stakes and strings. Seeing even the bare outline helps to guard against a chronic planning problem that can occur no matter who draws the plan--the underwhelming moment when the new area fills with people and furniture and seems smaller than the ample space you drew months ago on the back of a napkin.**

WHEN TO CALL FOR HELP
* Once you have plans for a remodeling project, you need to find contractors to carry them out--or maybe not. You can save money by handling part of the work yourself--**maybe 30 percent of the job price if you act as the general contractor of the project.** But you can run into pitfalls, too, mainly when you get in over your head on jobs that require skills you don't have. You may start with the best intentions but wind up getting in the way of pros who are accustomed to the daily regimen--and work weekdays when you're at that other job.
* There are no set rules about which jobs to tackle and which to leave to the pros. Do-it-yourself skills, interests, and budgets vary so widely that you might do an excellent job on part of the project your neighbor wouldn't touch. But there are sensible guidelines you can apply. Number one is "if in doubt, don't." Don't plunge into a project unless you have a realistic idea of the tools, skills, time, and money involved. Then you caan make common-sense decisions, including the most important one: whether or not you can do the work safely.
* So when you consider the array of jobs on a major remodeling project--from foundation work to roofing--the best approach is t oavoid work that is inherently dangerous. Naturally, that depends to some extent on your idea of danger. For one do-it-yourselfer, laying shingles on a low-slope roof may be a snap. But if you start sweating halfway up a ladder, even the simplest roof improvement can be hazardous. You don't need construction expertise to sort this out. There is a good reason painting is at the top of the do-it-yourself list and wiring is at the bottom: paint can't kill you.
* You can't rule out everyday accidents. Some scrapes and bruises are inevitable when handle a lot of tools and building materials. But it's wise to steer clear of jobs where problems due to lack of experience could result in structural defects and serious injury.
* As to structure, that means in most cases **you should leave foundations, framing, and similar work to the pros, and concentrate on finishing trades such as drywalling, trimming, and painting that use the structural systems for support**. Foul up on the surface and you may make a mess, but nothing is likely to collapse.
* As to injury, that means in most cases **you should let pros handle mechanical systems and equipment--heating and cooling, electrical, and plumbing.** Don't take a shot at installing a new furnace that could burn down the house if it's installed incorrectly. Plumbing is a bit of a gray area because on some pipes, the worst you'll get from a mistake is a leak, and you can fix leaks--or call a plumber. But making the wrong kind of connection on other piping, such as gas lines and sewer lines, can have serious consequences.

* If you don't know enough about a project to have a reasonable idea about its potential dangers and the crucial installation steps that prevent them, leave it alone. Also rule out installation work that could void a warranty and jobs that require special licenses or inspections. Removing asbestos is one good example; wiring a new addition is another. With the proper permits, you can pour a bump-out foundation and nail up framing on your own house, although a building inspector may pick your work apart. But in many areas there are jobs, such as installing a septic system and wiring, that won't be approved unless you are licensed to do the work.

Management Options
* If you decide to have others do most of the work, you may want to consider hiring a remodeling manager to monitor the job. **They have no standardized qualifications and no professional society, so finding one is often a matter of word of mouth.** Some provide supervision on the job site; others help you select materials and deal on your behalf with architects, designers, contractors, and even mortgage bankers. You may pay a flat fee or a percentage of the job price for what amounts to a hand-holding service provided by a manager who may be very helpful but doesn't design or build anything. But some homeowners need a friendly voice on the other end of the phone who will do some of their negotiating--someone who doesn't have a stake in the design or a hand in the construction.

        You contractor doesn't want to hear...
        "Youre' not eating dinner, are you?"
        It's aggravating to be constantly on call, and hand-holding a client day and night, Saturdays and Sundays, even though the questions can wait a few hours and both of you are done with work for the day and at home with other things to do.

* The next rung up from hiring a remodeling manager is managing--**acting as your own general contractor.** On the plus side, you can save at least some of the contractor's markup buying materials in bulk. However, you probably won't get the best price that suppliers reserve for repeat customers (year-round contractors), and you may not save anything on a small, one-time order.
* **The most taxing part of being a general contractor is hiring and managing several subcontractors. To start with, you probably won't get their best price, either. They might trim down a bid for the general contractor who keeps them working job to job--and who knows where the excess is--but not for you. You will save the general contractor's salary, of course, but only if you have the time to spend on site and figure your time is free. Don't try to run a remodeling job from your other job over the phone unless you're clairvoyant. You need to be there to see what's happening and have enough general contruction knowledge to understand what you're seeing. You don't have to know as much about electricity as the electrician. But you will need to be familiar with the basics of every trade so you aren't taken advantage of, or simply stumped by conversation about the project.**
* The best jobs to manage yourself are short in duration, relatively inexpensive--like adding new siding. Whole-house remodeling that involves plumbing, electrical, heating, cooling, and structural systems throughout the building are more difficult, **particularly kitchen and bathroom jobs that cram a lot of mechanical and finishing work into a small space.** As you hire more subs with different expertise, interests, and schedules, the job becomes exponentially more difficult to control.
* You may save money when you're the boss, but you'll be shouldering a lot of responsbility. It can be a difficult spot to be in--when the buck stops with you, and it's your own buck.

### Hiring a Contractor
* If every homeowner with a remodeling job gets a top contractor who comes highly recommended, put in 10-hour days, and always finshes on time, then who hires all the other guys? And when the economy is strong, loan rates are low, and a lot of homeowners are remodeling, how can you snag these top contractors? The search can be time-consuming and frustratin, and many contractors you call may be unavailable.
* **Locating the right contractor takes legwork: developing leads, tracking down referrals, verifying recommendations, conducting face-to-face interviews, and keeping track of the one who seemed so forthcoming and the one who rubbed you the wrong way.**
* The ideal shortcut is to hire a contractor recommended by a trusted friend or neighbor who has just finished a project like the one you have in mind--a situation where you'll be able to find out about costs, schedules, attitudes, and see the results firsthand. Short of that ideal, the best bet is to leave a lot of time for the search and to start with the biggest possible pool of qualified contractors. You can get names from many sources that generally fall into two categories: **referrals and recommendations.** Referrals come from advertisements--for instance, the side of a truck or a card posted at the lumberyard. There is no screening involved; there are just names.
* **Recommendations carry more weight than referrals because they include an evaluation--say, from a friend or neighbor, your home-owners' insurance agent, mortgage banker, real estate agent, or someone else in the housing business who knows who you want.**
* Before you start weeding out candidates, also consider the Internet. In a typical Web search, you'll get lost in lists of contracting firms halfway across the country. But keep looking and eventually you will hit trade associations, such as the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI, at www.nari.org), and a growing number of Internet-based contractor-referral services. Several online referral services are dead ends; either too new or too disorganized to use. You scroll through snappy-looking option screens (and ads to click on, of course), but when you finally start to zero in, it turns out that only a few states and countries can be searched--and yours is not among them.
* But fully operational sites, such as wwww.improvenet.com, one of the alrgest referral services with a national database of 600,000 contractors, help to make a match. You submit the particulars of your job and receive a list of screened contractors that omits anyone who has been in business less than three years and does not have a clean legal and credit record.
* The service is free to consumers, contractors pay for the referrals. It's a good way for them to get leads and screen out homeowners who aren't really serious about starting a project in the near future and are just shopping for ideas. a typical response, via email, may give you four local names within 48 hours. But there is no guarantee that these contractors will be agreeable, work for the price you have in mind, or produce high-quality results. All that is for you to discover.
* By whatever method, gather as many names as you can, and make the basic checks with local consumer protection agencies and the Better Business Bureau to find out if the contractor has a license, plus a record that is free of consumer complaints.
* Finally, the contractor must be available to do the job--but not immediately without a good explanation. You can'tbe the only one to find the guy. If he's good, a lot of people want him, and you may have to get in line.

### Watching the Budget
* Soliciting bids from remodeling, contractors is like shopping for any consumer service--just more dranw out and confusing. The main mystery is that even though the product--your project--is painstakingly defined with plans and specifications, everyone who looks at it sees a different price tag. **Few will be as low as the one you envision, and some will be so far from others that it will be hard to imagine the contractors are estimating the same job.**
* Variation can stem from basics like the law of supply and demand, of course. When loan rates are low, the weather is warm, and alot of homeowners are looking for estimates, availability falls and prices rise. If you solicit a highly sought-after contractor who doesn't really need the work, the estimate may soar.

        Your contractor doesn't want to hear...
        "So what do you think about these nine kinds of tile?"
        This syndrome occurs when clients in the thrall of a major remodeling project come to believe that their house is endlessly fascinating and fail to realize that rehashing every possible feature is like showing their most recent 200 baby pictures to a pediatrician.
