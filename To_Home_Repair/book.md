# Safety
* Though all the designs and methods in this book have been reviewed for safety, it is not possible to overstate the importance of using the safest construction methods you can. What follows are reminders--some doès and donèts of work safety. They are not subsitute for your own common sense.

* Always use caution, care, and good judgment when following the procedures described in this book.
* Always be sure that the electrical setup is safe, that no circuit is overloaded, and that all power tools and outlets are properly grounded. Do not use power tool in wet locations.
* Always read container labels on paints, solvents, and other products; provide ventilation; and observe all other warnings.
* Always read manufacturerès instruction for using a tool, especially the warnings.
* Use hold-downs and push sticks whenever possible when working on a table saw. Avoid working short pieces if you can.
* Always remove the key from any drill chuck (portable or press) before starting the drill.
* Always pay deliberate attention to how a tool works so that you can avoid being injured.
* Always know the limitations of your tools. Do not try to force them to do what they were not designed to do.
* Always make sure that any adjustment is locked before proceeding. For example, always check the rip fence on a table saw or the bevel adjustment on a portable saw before starting to work.
* Always clamp small pieces to a bench or other work surface when using a power tool on them.
* Always wear the appropriate rubber or work gloves when handling chemicals, moving or stacking lumber, or doing heavy construction.
* Always wear a disposable face mask when you create dust by sawing or sanding. Use a special filtering respirator when working with toxic substances and solvents.
* Always wear eye protection, especially when using power tools or striking metal on metal or concrete; a chip can fly off, for example, when chiseling concrete.
* Never work while wearing loose clothing, hanging hair, open cuffs, or jewelry.
* Always be aware that there is seldom enough time for your bodyès reflexes to save you from injury from a power tool in a dangerous situation; everything happens too fast. Be alert!
* Always keep your hands away from the business ends of blades, cutters, and bits.
* Always hold a circular saw firmly, usually with both hands so that you know where they are.
* Always use a drill with an auxilary handle to control the torge when large-size bits are used.
* Always check your local building codes when planning new construction. The codes are intended to protect public safety and should be observed to the letter.
* Never work with power tools when you are tired or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
* Never cut tiny pieces of wood or pipe using a power saw. Always cut small pieces off large pieces.
* Never change a saw blade or a drill or router bit unless the power cord is unplugged. Do not depend on the switch being off; you might accidentally hit it.
* Never work in insufficient lighting.
* Never work with dull tools, Have them sharpened, or learn how to sharpen them yourself.
* Never use a power tool on a workpiece--large or small--that is not firmly supported.
* Never saw a workpiece that spans a large distance between sawhorses without close support on each side of the cut; the piece can bend, closing on and jamming the blade, causing saw kickback.
* Never support a workpiece from underneath with your leg or other part of your body when sawing.
* Never carry sharp or pointed tools, such as utility knives, awls, or chisels, in your pocket. If you want to carry such tools, use a special-purpose tool belt with leather pockets and holders.
